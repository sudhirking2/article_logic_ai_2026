EXEMPLAR 3

INPUT TEXT
<<<
Students must complete either the written exam or the oral presentation, but not both, to satisfy the assessment requirement. A student passes the course if and only if they satisfy the assessment requirement and attend at least 80% of lectures. Students may request deadline extensions, though approval requires documented extenuating circumstances.
