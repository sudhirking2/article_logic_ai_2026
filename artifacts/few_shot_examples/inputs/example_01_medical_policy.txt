The hospital's emergency triage protocol requires immediate attention for patients presenting with chest pain, unless the pain is clearly musculoskeletal in origin and the patient is under 40 years old. Dr. Martinez, who has been working double shifts this week, believes that patients over 65 should always receive an ECG regardless of symptoms, though the official guidelines only mandate this when cardiac history is documented.

A patient, Mr. Chen, arrived at 3 AM complaining of chest discomfort that started after lifting heavy furniture. He is 38 years old and has no prior cardiac history, but his father died of a heart attack at 52. The attending nurse noted that Mr. Chen appeared anxious and was sweating, which could indicate either cardiac distress or simply anxiety from the late-night hospital visit. Dr. Martinez was not on duty, so the decision fell to Dr. Okonkwo, who generally follows official protocol strictly but makes exceptions when family history suggests elevated risk.

If Mr. Chen's symptoms resolve within 30 minutes without intervention, he will likely be discharged with instructions to follow up with his primary care physician. However, if the sweating continues or if he reports any radiating pain to his left arm, the protocol escalates to immediate cardiac workup regardless of age or apparent cause.
