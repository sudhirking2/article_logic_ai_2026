OpenIE Extractor Output - Execution Report
================================================================================

INPUT TEXT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The hospital's emergency triage protocol requires immediate attention for patients presenting with chest pain,
unless the pain is clearly musculoskeletal in origin and the patient is under 40 years old.
Dr. Martinez, who has been working double shifts this week, believes that patients over 65 should always receive an ECG regardless of symptoms, althought Dr. Yang only sometimes believes this.
The official guidelines only mandate this when cardiac history is documented.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTRACTION SUMMARY:
- Total triples extracted: 16
- OpenIE triples: 16
- Stanza fallback triples: 0
- Coreference resolution: Disabled (due to HuggingFace connectivity)

ANALYSIS NOTES
================================================================================

The OpenIE extractor successfully processed the medical triage text and extracted
16 relation triples. Key observations:

1. Protocol Requirements:
   - Captured the main protocol requirement about chest pain triage
   - Identified the age-based exception (under 40 years old)
   - Extracted musculoskeletal origin condition

2. Clinical Beliefs:
   - Extracted information about Dr. Martinez's belief regarding ECG for 65+ patients
   - Captured guideline requirements about cardiac history documentation

3. Attributes:
   - Identified various descriptive relations (immediate, official, documented, etc.)
   - Captured numeric relations (over 65, under 40 years)

4. Limitations:
   - Coreference resolution was disabled due to HuggingFace connectivity
   - Some complex conditional logic may not be fully captured in simple triples
   - The "believes" relationships between doctors and protocols are not explicitly extracted
