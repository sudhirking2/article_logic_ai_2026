Global food services company Sodexo has signed a revolving credit agreement incorporating a sustainability - linked clause . The latest iteration of the € 1.3bn deal ties the interest rate on the loan to the company ’s pledge to cut food waste and food losses stemming from its operations in half by 2025 . Sodexho , its suppliers , clients and consumers are responsible for 117,000 mt of the 1.3 billion mt of global food waste or loss each year , according to CEO Denis Machuel . In May it launched WasteWatch , a data - driven waste prevention programme . Machuel said the reduction of food waste is unacceptable both from an environmental and business perspective . Some of the biggest players in the food industry are actively seeking to strengthen their commitment to improving sustainability of the food chain by tying the interest rate on debt to goals to reduce waste . Leading global commodities traders Louis Dreyfus , Olam and Cofco have also signed sustainability - linked loans tied to their ESG targets and improvement of the traceability of agri - commodities this year . Overall , the sustainability - linked loan sector increased its fold last year reaching $ 40bn and banks are being urged to encourage broader adoption . It is clear that corporates are keen extend their ESG efforts beyond issuing green bonds , to fund investment in the necessary infrastructure and technology , to linking the cost of funding day - to - day operations with sustainability goals . In doing so their positive impact on the environment has a similarly positive impact on their financials .
