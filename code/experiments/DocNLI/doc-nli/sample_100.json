      "premise": "A Chinese-invested phosphate fertilizer plant, which is believed to be the first such plant in East Africa and marks the first phase of a 2.8 billion yuan ($410 million) industrial park in Uganda, is scheduled to start operations on Oct 23. The plant will use poly metallic mineral resources in Sukulu, Uganda, and have an installed capacity to produce 100,000 metric tons of fertilizer every year, said Lyu Weidong, chairman of Guangzhou Dongsong Energy Group Co, the main investor of the China (Guangdong)-Uganda International Industrial Cooperation Park. The park, located in Tororo district, is 180 kilometers from the Ugandan capital, Kampala, and close to the nation's border with Kenya to the east. A steel mill, also the first in East Africa and capable of rolling out 350,000 tons of steel products a year, is expected to start production in July next year, Lyu said. The complex, covering an area of 1,800 acres, will include a glass plant, a yellow phosphorus plant, as well as crop farms, which include coffee, tea and rice farms and use the fertilizer made in the park. It will also include a machinery maintenance plant and a testing center catering to the entire East African region. A burning-free brick factory will be installed to recycle the tailing from the beneficiation plant, slags from steel mills and quartz sand from the glass plant. Excessive heat from the steel plant will be used for residential heating and speeding up brick molding. The coal gas from steel production will be reused within the steel plant and some other plants. Both residential and industrial waste water will be treated and recycled within the park. \"We will not sacrifice the environment for any short-term economic benefit,\" Lyu said, adding a circular economy has been encouraged by the Chinese government. The complex will benefit local employment in the agriculture-dominant country, creating at least 2,500 jobs in the projects in the park and about 2,000 jobs in supporting sectors, he said. When completed in 2020, the park will generate total output of about 3.5 billion yuan. The park is listed as a key project of the Uganda Vision 2040 program, he said. The program envisions for \"A Transformed Ugandan Society from a Peasant to a Modern and Prosperous Country within 30 years.\" The project is ideally placed to capitalize on the rich mineral resources in Uganda and is adjacent to a number of neighboring countries, said Liu Jisen, executive dean of the Institute for African Studies of the Guangdong University of Foreign Studies.

      "premise": "Is there room in the market for yet another streaming service? Viacom thinks so. The company, on its earnings call on Thursday, said it’s planning to launch its own ad-supported streaming service by September 2018, the end of its fiscal year. The service will include “tens of thousands of hours of content” from across Viacom’s library. Viacom had hinted about its plans in streaming before, but it shared a few more details on the call about what the service will include. The company, which owns cable TV channels like MTV and Comedy Central, already licenses some of its content to other streaming services like Sling TV and DirecTV Now, as well as newcomer Philo (which it’s invested in.) But it’s also withheld a lot from third-parties, which it believes will be a strategic advantage. “It’s going to be rolled out in the U.S., in terms of the amount of content that it’s going to have, it’s going to have tens of thousands of hours of content that cut across the library we have on a global basis. And it’s important to note one of the reasons that we are able to do this is that we’ve chosen to curtail the amount of content that we license into third-party B2C experiences,” said Viacom CFO Wade Davis, on the call. That’s hurt Viacom in the short-term, he noted, because the company hasn’t been able to fully take advantage of the licensing revenue it could have otherwise pulled in from other subscription video on-demand services. The company didn’t precisely detail what the new service would include, in terms of programming, but did hint that Viacom will tap into its larger portfolio to differentiate its offering with content that can’t necessarily be found elsewhere. “You should assume that we are really putting all of Viacom’s assets against this,” Davis added, noting that Viacom’s brands span categories like kids and family, music, comedy, African-American, and general entertainment. He also referenced Viacom’s entertainment presence via its brands Paramount, Paramount TV and the new Paramount Network, but didn’t specifically say how Paramount content would come into play in the new offering. Additionally, the company stressed that the service is not designed for cord cutters, necessarily. That means, it’s not positioned as a way to watch Viacom’s programming when you ditch your cable or satellite TV subscription in favor of streaming. Instead, Viacom says it sees it as an “MVPD [multichannel video programming distributor, like a cable TV provider] complement product.”",
      "hypothesis": "Media conglomerate Viacom will launch its own streaming service in September, at the end of its fiscal year, according to CFO Wade Davis. The company is also planning a new app for Apple TV, which it acquired last year from Apple. Although Davis did not give away many details, he said the service would be more like a multi-channel video programming distributor than a cord-cutter.",

      "premise": "By Jenny Awford For Daily Mail Australia Published: 02:25 EDT, 30 March 2016 | Updated: 03:40 EDT, 30 March 2016 Australia's credit card debt has exploded to a 'dangerous' level of $50.9 billion after consumers signed up for an extra 1.5 million credit cards in the past five years, according to new figures. The sharp rise has prompted experts to warn against splurging on credit cards to avoid paying crippling levels of interest. New Reserve Bank of Australia data shows that the debt accruing interest is as much as $32.3 billion - with an average of around $4,300 per card holder. This means that the standard card holder is paying around $700 in interest per year if their interest rate is between 15 to 20 per cent. New Reserve Bank of Australia data shows that the debt accruing interest is as much as $32.3 billion The figures show that Australians are paying a total of more than $5.5 billion a year of credit card interest. The number of credit cards held by Australians has increased by almost 10 per cent in the past five years, news.com.au reported. Data also shows that credit limits on cards have climbed even faster, up 4 per cent in just 12 months. They are expected to reach a staggering $150 billion for the first time this year. The sharp rise has prompted experts to warn against splurging on credit cards to avoid paying crippling levels of interest Experts have warned that using more than one credit card could result in more fees and debt problems spiralling out of control. Consumer finance specialist Lisa Montgomery said that many customers are getting new cards and keeping the old ones. 'The obvious danger is you can overspend and have got that temptation,' she said. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission's MoneySmart website also offers a range of advice. It suggests that people should 'stop adding more debt to your credit card' and 'pay more than the minimum repayment'. The site said that if you have $4,400 of credit card debt and only make the minimum repayments, it will take you 31 years to pay it off and cost you around $14,900 in interest. Advertisement",

GE Mining, which comes under the transportation segment of GE, claimed this digital suite to improve the reliability, performance, operations and safety of the mines. As per the company’s press release, it sees the mining sites as a mini-city that requires power, water, and transportation. Through the implementation of this software, the miners will not only be able to have real-time access across these mines, but will be able also optimize their cost through received on-the-spot data. The real-time achievement will be made possible through GE’s cloud-based Predix platform that was built exclusively to cater this industry. During the exhibition, GE Mining’s VP and CEO, Scott Phillips shared his remarks: “Mining, as an industry, faces strong headwinds and must drive productivity and improve operational savings. Digital Mine, through advanced sensor technology and analytics, seizes the industry’s untapped data to help make a difference.” He further added: “As we’re doing successfully for the rail industry, we’re using our Industrial Internet mindset to actively monitor and diagnose equipment and operations to improve assets, maximize efforts, boost fuel efficiency, and lower costs.” General Electric has introduced this product at the time when mining industry is serious over cost cutting and for which it is going through assets divestment. Hence, it is likely to gain much attended attention from the target audience. GE claims this suite to gather a variety of information, including vibration data, temperature, and pressure, through which the miners could trigger the machine’s health and take actions accordingly, hence increasing productivity while minimizing any prospective mishap.

      "premise": "IBM disclosed that French premium foods company Labeyrie and Italy’s Gruppo Grigi joined IBM Food Trust for blockchain traceability. Labeyrie will be using the platform for tracking certain Norwegian smoked salmon products from yesterday. And Gruppo Grigi will launch traceability for its Aliveris pasta brand later this year. Labeyrie will be using the technology for the provenance of its salmon stocks sourced from farmer Cermaq. Consumers can scan the QR code printed on the packaging to get details such as the species, origin, farming conditions, and preparation. “Product traceability is an essential component of our mission to provide complete transparency to consumers about the premium quality of our smoked salmon and the requirements we meet in its preparation,” said Céline Porterie, project manager at Labeyrie Fine Foods. Over the past few months, several companies have joined the permissioned blockchain platform including Raw Seafoods earlier this month. Seafood traceability is a popular use case for the platform and food traceability in general. This is owing to consumer concerns about sustainable fish farming, the use of chemicals to accelerate growth and mislabelling the source of some fish. Meanwhile, for Gruppo Grigi, blockchain will certify that its Aliveris pasta, is made from organic Italian wheat and non-GMO products. Gruppo Grigi’s Food Italiae distributes the pasta brand. The Italian group intends to introduce more products from its portfolio onto the blockchain. Using IBM’s platform, customers can view details regarding the product from the origin of the organic wheat seeds, cropping, farming activities, to the forming of the pasta shape and its transport. Founded in 2017, IBM Food Trust has a high profile in blockchain food traceability. It uses Hyperledger Fabric blockchain technology. One of its most significant applications is to use the platform for food recalls particularly leafy greens. The World Health Organisation says that annually, one in ten people suffer from foodborne diseases.

The collection of 15 hotels is being priced at $5.5bn, reported The Wall Street Journal. The portfolio of hotels includes San Francisco’s Westin St. Francis hotel; Essex House Hotel in Manhattan; Four Seasons Hotel at Jackson Hole in Wyoming; InterContinental hotels in Chicago and Miami. Earlier this year, there were rumours that private equity firm Blackstone was in negotiations to acquire several of the assets it divested to Anbang in 2016. The Government of China took control of the insurance firm in February after a probe by the country’s insurance regulatory commission. According to the regulatory body, the insurance firm had violated regulations, which raised concerns over its ability to pay insurance claims. The government took control of Anbang to stop it from a financial collapse. Since the takeover, Anbang has secured $9.7bn in capital to stabilise its operations, and now the insurance firm has been ordered to divest its assets. The recent years has seen the US luxury hotel market’s valuation drop. In 2015, the market had sales of $22bn, which dropped to $5.2bn in 2018. Only a few companies can afford to pay the price paid by Anbang. This restricts mostly sovereign-wealth funds and private equity firms to afford the price Anbang is seeking.

      "premise": "Moving stuff by air may be quick and convenient, but it’s also horridly expensive, accounting for just 1 percent of global shipping by volume—and 35 percent of it by cost. So while autonomous drones dropping a few pounds of snacks or medical supplies are generating plenty of buzz, two Bulgarian brothers see an opening in the long-haul business. And they think they’ve got the tech to start flying hundreds of pounds of cargo over hundreds of miles, no pilot or 747 required. Svilen and Konstantin Rangelov are the CEO and chief technology officer, respectively, of Dronamics. They’ve spent the past four years developing an aircraft that can haul nearly 800 pounds of cargo up to 1,550 miles, a far cry from the 10 or 15 miles, or even just a few blocks, that most drone delivery services are targeting. “Most small delivery drones are an attempt to solve the last-mile problem,” Svilen Rangelov says. Dronamics is looking at the leg of the journey that comes before that. “They are the bike messenger, we are the cross-country truck.” The problem with the current air transport system, Svilen says, is that it relies on moving a few, very big, and very expensive airplanes between major airports. When combined with cost of getting goods from the nearest airport that can handle an airliner to their final destination, the costs pile up. If you’ve got the money; the time and distance requirements; and the bulk to justify sending your stuff by air, it works fine. Otherwise, not so much. “This is why domestic cargo flights are a rarity in almost all countries in the world,” Svilen says. The Rangelovs’ solution is a mission-tailored cargo craft called Black Swan. The fixed-wing aircraft, which uses a gasoline engine and a single nose-mounted propeller, can be monitored via satellite, fly into and out of small unpaved air strips, and could operate at a cost at least 50 percent lower than conventional, human-piloted cargo aircraft. A quarter-scale prototype with a wingspan of 13 feet—the final version will be the size of a conventional small airplane, thus far more substantial than the average sneaker-delivering quadcopter—flew in trials at military and civilian airports in Bulgaria over several months last year, with the engineers validating the aerodynamics, autopilot system, and satellite communications technology. The fixed-wing airplane is designed for the kind of lower density cargo typical of ecommerce deliveries, as opposed to heavy, tightly packaged pallets typically crammed into cargo planes. So for predominantly individually packaged and wrapped products like smartphones, food, medicine, and, sure, sneakers, “We focused on getting a payload that could match the most common type of ground vehicle in the world—the small cargo van,” Konstantin says. “This meant we can create an aircraft the size of a bush plane, and we could make it land at even very short runways, significantly expanding the number of towns that we can connect.”",
      "hypothesis": "Bulgaria-based Dronamics has developed autonomous drone technology designed to carry large loads of cargo for longer distances than existing delivery drones, and at a lower cost than current air transport. The company’s aircraft, known as Svilen, can cover distances of up to 1,550 miles and carry loads of around 800 pounds. Cheaper to produce and run than conventional cargo aircraft, the drone will be the size of a small aeroplane, and is designed to carry lower density e-commerce type cargo, such as smartphones and medicine.",

      "premise": "The Israeli robotic cleaning specialist for the solar industry has completed a new funding round that will support the firm’s global expansion, meet growing demand and boost R&D. Ecoppia, the Israeli-headquartered producer of water-free, robotic cleaning solutions for solar panels, has this week completed a $13 million funding round that will help steer its expansion efforts. Existing investors in Ecoppia led the funding round, including GlenRock, Gandyr and Swarth Group, and now joined by Harel Group Insurance and Finance – the largest insurer in Israel. The completion will help Ecoppia expand on an already noteworthy year in which it was ranked in the top ten of Deloitte’s 2017 Technology Fast 50. According to Ecoppia, over the past four years the company has posted growth of more than 1,600% as its cloud-based cleaning solutions have found a large target audience in the utility-scale markets of India, MENA, Latin America and Europe. Next year, Ecoppia says that its pipeline is expected to top 2 GW, having already seen its solution clean its 200 millionth solar panel in 2017. Leading ECPs and developers that have adopted Ecoppia’s solution include Adani Power, Terraform, EDF and India’s NTPC. According to Harel Group, which is now a backer of the firm, Ecoppia’s cleaning solution – which the company claims can remove 99% of dust on a panel daily without any water required – has been a game-changer for the industry. “They’ve successfully identified a critical need in the solar industry and created a reliable and cost-effective solution that contributes to lowering LCOE worldwide,” said a Harel Group spokesperson. The Ecoppia solution’ cloud connection links it instantly to advanced data analysis, meaning the machine learns on the job, and can therefore offer an optimized level of performance for each plant, the company states. The extra cash raised in this latest funding round will, said Ecoppia CEO and co-founder Eran Meller, enable the company to “continue serving the largest energy players in the world, meeting the requirement of the top financial institutions involved in cleantech, and the growing demand of our pipeline”.",

Abu Khdeir , 16 , was beaten and burned alive by three Israelis in July , according to prosecutors .

Gunmen also stormed the Central Security headquarters in Khormaksar district of the southern port city, sparking fierce clashes. No group has said it was responsible, but Islamic State and al-Qaeda have carried out similar attacks before. Aden is serving as the home of Yemen's government. Pro-government forces and troops from a Saudi-led multinational coalition forces are seeking to retake the capital, Sanaa, from Houthi rebels. They regained control of Aden last summer, but they have struggled to secure it. About two dozen militants were involved in Wednesday's attack in Khormaksar, which acts as a bridge between the mainland and a peninsula where much of Aden lies and is the location of the city's international airport. The attackers, who were reportedly wearing military uniforms, stormed the Central Security base in the morning after setting off a car bomb at its entrance then detonating another inside, a security source told the AFP news agency. The military sent reinforcements to the scene, where they traded rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire with the militants. By Wednesday afternoon the troops had regained control of the base after killing several of the militants, commander Gen Nasser Sarie told AFP. In May, at least 40 people, most of them army recruits, were killed in two bomb attacks in Aden that were claimed by IS. The jihadist group was also behind three bomb attacks on pro-government forces on 27 June in the eastern port city of Mukalla that killed 38 people. At least 6,400 people, half of them civilians, have been killed and almost three million others have been displaced since March 2015, when the Saudi-led coalition launched a military campaign to defeat the Houthis. The conflict has also pushed the Arab world's poorest country to the brink of famine and left 82% of the population in need of humanitarian assistance.",

      "premise": "The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee says hearings are planned next year into how the U.S. Forest Service handled last summer's stubborn wildfires that scorched the West, including one-third of Yellowstone National Park. ``The major problem is that in speaking to people from the area, you speak to two and you get three opinions,'' says Rep. Kika de la Garza, a Texas Democrat. ``The best thing to do is to sit down and have them all put it on the record and then sift through what happened and see if anything needs to be done.'' De la Garza said the hearings would focus on forest fire practices, and ``can a catastrophe of that nature be avoided or was it a catastrophe?'' ``I was in Montana and I visited with some people and I have some concern over some of the practices of the Forest Service,'' de la Garza said in an interview last week. The hearings will focus on fire fighting policies, rehabilitation of charred areas and on scientific research being done on the summer fires, said a subcommittee staff member. De la Garza says the committee also plans dozens of hearings nationwide in preparation for the 1990 Farm Bill and will look at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's response to this year's drought-relief legislation. The committee will consider a uniform pesticide labeling law and legislation to protect ground water from agricultural pesticides and fertilizers, de la Garza said. De la Garza said he hopes the House Interior Committee, which has jurisdiction over the National Park Service, and the Agriculture subcommittee on forests, with jurisdiction over the U.S. Forest Service, will hold joint hearings on last summer's wildfires, the worst in a century. The U.S. Forest Service said 5 million acres were charred in the raging blazes, including 706,000 acres in Yellowstone. The Forest and National Park Service spent a combined $300 million fighting the summer fires, the Forest Service said. The most severe were in and around Yellowstone and Alaska, although there were fires in the South, California and the Pacific Northwest. Drought conditions, high winds and a ``tremendous build-up'' of tinder, in Yellowstone in particular, helped make the 1988 fires the worst in a hundred years, officials said.",

Investors will be able to invest in diversified portfolios of stocks and ETFs, using automated, algorithm-based portfolio management advice. The platform offers a guided investment journey with regular rebalancing of investments portfolios – without having to interact with a relationship manager. The pilot will initially involve accredited investors and will later be extended to non-accredited investors. The robo-advisory service is being provided in partnership with WeInvest, a Singapore-based fintech firm. Under the pilot scheme, select participants will be able to access the online platform and invest into two categories of investment portfolios, starting from as low as SGD3,000. The first category consists of five portfolios made up of ETFs and equities listed on the Dow Jones and Nasdaq. To use the platform, customers initially answer a questionnaire to determine their risk profile and investment goals, enabling one of five portfolios to be suggested to them. Thereafter, the platform will automatically monitor the chosen portfolio. If economic and market conditions change and the performance of the portfolio diverges from the investment goals, investors will be alerted via SMS or email with proposals to rebalance their portfolios. The second category is designed to appeal to more savvy investors and offers them the opportunity to invest in a thematic basket of stocks listed on the Dow Jones and Nasdaq.

However, unlike VCs and angels, there is a dearth of information on how the various players in the corporate venture sector operate. As part of our ongoing efforts to level the playing field for healthcare entrepreneurs, MedCity News has partnered with Lake Whillans to conduct independent research on corporate venture capital. Previously, we took a look at life science corporate venture capital. Today, we deliver our findings on corporate venture capital in the digital health space. Who are the most trustworthy digital health corporate investors, according to the MedCity News audience? (Rating scale from 1 to 4 (highest).) We then separated out respondents who had direct interaction with these organizations and asked, “Which organizations provided the best experience for entrepreneurs?” The scores, according to the MedCity News-Lake Whillans survey: Full rankings are over at the Lake Whillans website. Something fascinating happened when we dug into the “trust” responses in our survey. It seems the more someone worked with these organizations, the less they trusted them. For all respondents on the issue of trust, the mean rating (on our four-point scale) for corporate venture funds is 1.97. However, for those who have firsthand experience, the average score is 1.82. On the other hand, for those who know these corporates by reputation alone, the average score is 2.06. It would appear that deeper familiarity does not correlate with positive perception. Digital health has seen huge recent increase in funding and investment and, inevitably, entrepreneurs are compiling experience on which organizations are most trustworthy (or not), which add the most value as partners, and who they would like to work with again in the future. We reached out to our audience by way of our Lake Whillans/MedCity Digital Health Investment Survey, and more than 160 professionals at the intersection of digital health and venture capital shared their insights and experiences. This survey focused on corporate investors focused on digital health companies, which encompass mobile, social media, genetics big data, and more. We provide you this research because, unlike more established investment sectors, there’s much less insight on corporate VCs and their practices.

      "premise": "Pension funds are caught between sustained low interest rates and “the unintended consequences of a variety of market regulations,” explained authors Mark Austin and Steve Irwin. “In times of market stress, the repo market could shut down, or a bank may not be able to provide an investor with direct cash,” the paper continued. Therefore, funds must diversify their portfolios’ liquidity sources in order to gain the “strongest protection” against future market turbulence. According to the whitepaper, some pension schemes are increasing their allocation to cash to as much as 7 percent of their portfolios. In previous environments, investors could earn as much as 2 to 3 percent by holding cash, but, today, they must settle for no returns, or even suffer negative rates. “Cash has gone from being a benign by-product of investing to arguably the essential facet of a lot of investment strategies.” Turning to regulation, Irwin and Austin cited the US Dodd-Frank Act, the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation and the EU’s Solvency II Directive as all bringing unintended consequences through their liquidity requirements. A separate report by the Dutch asset manager APG and the Dutch pension fund provider PGGM, two of Europe’s largest pension funds, along with the Insight Investment and MN, estimated that if European pension funds were required to centrally clear derivatives trades and post cash for variation margin, the total collateral required for a 1 percent rate shift would range from €205 billion to €255 billion. In more stressed scenarios, it could reach €420 billion. “If interest rates in the current market environment move by a quarter of a percent—which some industry participants argue would not be uncommon—then, collectively, European pension funds would be required to post intra-day margins of approximately €55 billion, stated Northern Trust’s paper. \"So, while more central clearing has de-risked the market, it has unintentionally given investors new kinds of liquidity challenges.” By way of possible solutions to what the paper describes as the “liquidity conundrum”, funds should identify “unusual sources of liquidity”, such as securities available for repo activities or securities lending. Funds should also maintain a liquidity ladder to forecast needs and match them with known cash flows, while modelling the asset liquidity profile and stress testing it to understand the true benefit and cost of embedded funding costs, as well as margin requirements on derivatives positions.",
      "hypothesis": "Pension funds may be most at risk if the repo market \"shut down\" due to stress conditions, as they are caught between sustained low interest rates and “unintended consequences\" of market regulations, warns a white paper by Northern Trust. The paper points to cash becoming \"the essential facet of investment strategies\" rather than a benign by-product, with some pension scheme cash allocations edging 1 percent. It suggests that funds diversify the liquidity sources of their portfolios to protect against future market turbulence.",

The first cargo of around one million barrels, valued at $60m, is expected to leave for customers in Asia this week. Future deliveries are expected to contain between 600,000 and two million barrels, according to Equinor. Equinor Marketing, Midstream & Processing (MMP) executive vice-president Irene Rummelhoff said: “This is a great day for Equinor and the Johan Sverdrup partnership, consisting of Lundin Norway, Petoro, Aker BP and Total. “This day also marks the start of a new phase as we prepare to bring Johan Sverdrup oil to the international market.” At the Mongstad complex, the oil piped from the field is stored in caverns and is ready to be shipped to markets across the globe. The Mongstad refinery is expected to receive up to 440,000bpd from the Johan Sverdrup project, once the first development phase operates at full capacity. Rummelhoff added: “Oil from Johan Sverdrup is expected to provide revenue of more than Nkr1,400bn for the next 50 years, of which more than Nkr900bn will go to the Norwegian state and society.” Once completed in 2022, the second phase will deliver up to 660,000bpd to Mongstad. The plant will receive more than 30% of the total oil from the Norwegian continental shelf once both the phases of the Johan Sverdrup field operate at peak production. Loading ... Mongstad complex vice-president Rasmus Wille said: “This is a big day for everyone who has worked for a long time on preparing Mongstad for oil from Johan Sverdrup. It has been a major effort involving plant modifications and completion of pipes.” Earlier in October 2019, Equinor and the Johan Sverdrup partnership started production from Phase I of the Johan Sverdrup field.",

After all, there are rather a lot of companies which have huge paper stores which could be valuable if they were able to be easily searched.But what has stopped it happening is that most of the files have staples, paperclips or are shoved in binders.Ripcord uses robots to do it at a cost of .004 cents per page -- for every month that it's stored in the cloud.Woz isn’t known for making a lot of investments, so the participation of the Apple founder is a nice addition.Ripcord was cofounded by Alex Fielding, who was an engineer at Apple in the 1990s.",

      "premise": "Elon Musk has admitted that automation has been holding back Tesla’s Model 3 production and that humans, rather than machines, were the answer. The electric car maker’s chief executive said that one of the reasons Tesla has struggled to reach promised production volumes was because of the company’s “excessive automation”. Asked whether robots had slowed down production, rather than speeding it up, during a tour around Tesla’s factory by CBS, Musk replied: “Yes, they did … We had this crazy, complex network of conveyor belts … And it was not working, so we got rid of that whole thing.” “Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated,” Musk added later. Caught in what Musk has called “manufacturing hell”, the electric car firm has failed to hit its weekly production target of 2,500 Model 3 vehicles in the first quarter of 2018, fostering doubt within the industry that Tesla will be able to hit its 5,000-a-week target in three months time. The significant production shortfall has delayed crucial customer deliveries. Musk said he was forced to take direct control of the production line at the beginning of April, resorting to pulling all-nighters and sleeping at the factory. “We were able to unlock some of the critical things that were holding us back from reaching 2,000 cars a week. But since then, we’ve continued to do 2,000 cars a week,” he said. At the same time Tesla is facing negative publicity over a fatal crash of one of its Model X SUVs that was driving using the firm’s Autopilot mode, openly feuding with the US National Transportation Safety Board and attempting to suppress issues before media attention.",

It has failed to reach the planned level of 2,500 vehicles per week, leading to delays in customer deliveries and raising doubts about whether its 5,000 per week target is achievable. Musk suggested more human workers will be needed to make the production process work more effectively.",

The company said in a press release that it wants to “demonstrate that it is possible to create high-protein shots exclusively with whey. Despite recent growth in global launches of protein drinks, no such product currently exists.” The new prototype, which Arla has dubbed “Protein Extreme,” features 20 g of high-quality whey protein in a 100-ml, low-calorie (98Kcal) shot-sized serving. The product is made with Arla’s Lacprodan HYDRO.365 whey protein hydrolysate, which the company says helps speed up muscle recovery after exercise due to its amino acid composition and fast absorption rate. The company says the ingredient is also flexible when formulating at a range of pH levels, expanding possible applications, and that it is also UHT-stable so that it can be easily produced on a standard UHT line. “As our new concept demonstrates, it is possible to get a huge amount of high-quality whey protein into a small shot,” said Anne Louis Friis, sales development manager, Arla Foods Ingredients. “There is currently a gap in the market for a protein shot made exclusively with whey, so this is a great opportunity for differentiation.” Visit SupplySide West Booth #1252 for more information.",

      "premise": "The reliable performance of refinery and petrochemical plant facilities is vital to an industry that is determined by global fluctuations in crude prices. Strategic investment is critical in overall profitability as an efficient plant can offset extreme market deviations. Finding trusted partners to supply dependable technology in any part of the world is essential to refiners and petrochemical companies. With this significant acquisition, Sulzer Chemtech is consolidating its role as a petrochemical process technology provider. Adding to the company’s capacity to design and deliver a broad range of offerings from refinery column internals to complete bioplastic (PLA) production plants, the new expanded business expands Sulzer’s capability into a much wider territory. The complementary scope of GTC’s expertise pushes Sulzer Chemtech further into technology licensing for the refinery and petrochemical industry, including complete engineering packages, proprietary equipment, and the supply of chemical solvents and catalysts. The two businesses agree there is a huge potential for growth. “GTC Technology has successfully applied its process technologies to complete many significant projects. We believe that together we could massively increase the business in three to five years.” explains Daniel Rytz, Global Head Strategy & Business Development at Sulzer Chemtech. Chuck Fink, Manager - Corporate Communications at GTC Technology, comments: “The entire staff at GTC is very excited about becoming part of Sulzer’s team and the opportunities that a larger provider of separation equipment offers. Our customers will certainly benefit from the synergy between our businesses, a greater depth of resources and a more comprehensive offering.” Both Sulzer and GTC Technology’s engineering teams are looking forward to sharing knowledge and strengthening their overall manufacturing capabilities. Now, GTC customers can benefit from Sulzer’s global network of facilities for designing, manufacturing, testing, maintaining and repairing mass transfer components. Similarly, Sulzer was keen to expand its operations in South Korea, where GTC has a large, established manufacturing center. Daniel Rytz adds: “Based on a year-long discussion with GTC prior to the purchase, I could clearly see the signs of strong chemistry and compatibility between the companies. Our ways of thinking and views on future development are similar and well-aligned. These contribute to the creation of a motivational working environment that nurtures new ideas and ensures continuous improvement of our solutions.”",
      "hypothesis": "Sulzer Chemtech has acquired US-based petrochemical firm GTC Technology in a move enabling Sulzer to broaden its petrochemical and refinery services by adding licensed technology, engineering packages, proprietary equipment and chemical solvents and catalysts supplies. The acquisition of GTC’s assets will enable the company to expand into new markets including North America, Europe and Asia.",

For decades , the U.S. military has maintained its dominance in the depths of the world 's oceans by boasting the most technologically advanced submarine fleet . However , officials say China and other nations are rapidly expanding the size and scope of their own submarine forces . And , according to a report by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments , the U.S. must rethink the role of manned submarines and prioritize new underwater detection techniques . `` We know they are out experimenting and looking at operating , and clearly want to be in this world of advanced submarines , '' Vice Adm. Joseph Mulloy told the House Armed Services Committee 's sea power subcommittee in February . Mulloy , who is deputy chief of naval operations for capabilities and resources , says Chinese submarines are still technologically inferior to those used by the United States , but that margin of difference is shrinking . Concern that China could match U.S. underwater capabilities in the near future has encouraged the development of an unmanned drone ship to independently track enemy ultra-quiet diesel electric submarines over thousands of miles to limit their tactical capacity for surprise . Initiated by a Pentagon research group called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the Anti-Submarine Warfare Continuous Trail Vessel ( ACTUV ) would be able to operate under with little supervisory control but also as remotely controlled or piloted vessels , depending on the circumstances of specific missions . `` We 're looking for test-ready , multi-sensor approaches that push the boundaries of today 's automated sensing systems for unmanned surface vessels , '' said Scott Littlefield , DARPA program manager . `` Enhancing the ability of these kinds of vessels to sense their environment in all weather and traffic conditions , day or night , would significantly advance our ability to conduct a range of military missions . '' DARPA says the so-called drone ships will be 132 feet long and likely cost about $ 20 million , significantly less than the billion-dollar manned warships currently in use . The development of the ACTUV aligns with the `` culture change '' described by Navy Secretary Ray Mabus Tuesday at the Navy League 's Sea Air Space symposium at National Harbor , Maryland . `` Unmanned systems , particularly autonomous ones , have to be the new normal in ever-increasing areas , '' Maybus said .

      "premise": "Rent the Runway, the company known for lending designer dresses to women for special occasions, has received a new round of financing that increased its valuation to the unicorn level of $1 billion. The valuation announced on Thursday is a milestone for Rent the Runway, which was founded a decade ago and has been working for years to expand its business beyond formal dress rentals. It introduced a subscription service for everyday clothing and accessories several years ago that has developed a particularly enthusiastic customer base among professional women. Recently, it announced a partnership with West Elm that will allow subscribers to rent “bundles” of pillows, throws and quilts for their living rooms and bedrooms. “You’ll continue to see that this new living closet that we’ve created is going to apply not only to how you get dressed, but it’ll apply to all of the products that you use,” Jennifer Hyman, 38, the company chief executive and a co-founder, said in a phone interview. “Our goal is really to create the Amazon Prime of rental.” The company said it had brought in $125 million in the latest fund-raising round, which was led by Franklin Templeton Investments and Bain Capital Ventures. That brings the total equity the New York-based company has raised to $337 million, and adds to a $200 million credit facility it secured in August. Those who subscribe to Rent the Runway can borrow up to four items at a time for $159 per month, cycling through designer garments and accessories — including maternity wear — with the option to buy goods at discounted prices. Rent the Runway declined to disclose its subscriber count or its revenue or to say if it was profitable. The company plans to expand into more product categories, establish a second distribution facility in Dallas and open a new 8,000-square-foot store in San Francisco. Ms. Hyman said the additions would enable West Coast customers to have “an equivalent experience” to customers on the East Coast. She also said the company was aiming to improve its subscription service by potentially increasing the number of items customers can rent at one time and expanding a budding network of drop-off locations, including at WeWork spaces. Merchandise is scanned at these drop-off locations, making customers immediately able to rent more items. Rent the Runway, which received its first investment in May 2009, sought to build relationships with investors in this fund-raising round who would support the company if it decided to go public. “We’re readying the company for all options,” Ms. Hyman said. Tech investors have been paying close attention to retail companies that were built online, from secondhand apparel start-ups like The RealReal and Poshmark to Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service. While there are plenty of cautionary tales, like the short-lived boom in flash sale sites, Stitch Fix has seen its stock soar since it went public in 2017. The RealReal and Poshmark remain private.",

      "premise": "Sulfur pollution from coal burning has a similar effect. Some studies suggest that China’s surge in coal consumption over the last decade partly offset the recent global warming trend (though coal does have a strong net warming effect). It’s difficult to estimate how much the new rule could affect temperatures. We don’t know enough about cloud physics and the behavior of atmospheric particles, nor how diligently the shipping industry will comply with the new rule, says Robert Wood, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington. Another wrinkle is that ships emit other particles that can sometimes also stimulate cloud droplets to form, including black carbon, a major component of soot. Removing the sulfur from the fuel could alter the size and quantity of these particles, which could affect clouds as well, says Lynn Russell, a professor of atmospheric science at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. “So we can’t really say exactly what the change will be,” says Russell, though she adds that the rule change is “likely” to produce a warming effect on balance. The upcoming change does offer a different way of thinking about intentional efforts to cool the climate, known as geoengineering, according to some proponents of research in this area. Rather than some radical experiment, deliberate geoengineering could instead be seen as a way of continuing to do what we’ve been doing inadvertently with ships, but in a safer way. Sulfur emissions cool the planet in two ways, directly and indirectly. The direct way is that when sulfur dioxide is further oxidized in the atmosphere, it can form particles that reflect sunlight back into space. This happens in large volcanic eruptions, which can release tens of millions of tons of sulfur dioxide. The indirect way is that sulfur particles can also act as nuclei around which cloud droplets form. Clouds, too, reflect more sunlight. You can see this in satellite images, which show lines of white clouds above the ocean along busy shipping lanes. Geoengineering researchers have explored both processes, but with less toxic particles, as potential ways to alter the climate (see “Scientists Consider Brighter Clouds to Preserve the Great Barrier Reef”). For instance, researchers with the Marine Cloud Brightening Project, centered at the University of Washington, have spent years studying the possibility of spraying tiny salt particles into the sky along coastlines to induce cloud droplets to form. The group has spent the last few years attempting to raise several million dollars to build the sort of sprayers that would be needed, in the hopes of carrying out small-scale field experiments somewhere along the Pacific coastline.",
      "hypothesis": "International regulations to cut down on toxic emissions by the shipping industry could have the effect of making climate change worse, according to some scientists. The UN's International Maritime Organisation is introducing rules requiring shipping vessels to reduce the amount of sulphur pollution by changing to lower-sulphur fuels or installing exhaust-cleaning systems. However, some research suggests that sulphur emissions have had a cooling effect on the atmosphere, by forming particles in the atmosphere that reflect sunlight back into space, and helping form clouds, which do the same. Reducing sulphur emissions could therefore lead to a net warming effect.",

After Boga had an attempt spilled by the keeper , Solanke was on hand to poach his second and Chelsea 's third . Solanke has now netted 11 goals in this year 's Youth League and is the competition 's leading scorer . The rout was completed when Abraham , on from the bench , converted Kasey Palmer 's cross . Roma 's Toni Sanabria ( right ) prepares to take on Chelsea's Ola Aina ( left ) in the UEFA Youth League match .",
      "hypothesis": "Chelsea youth striker Dominic Solanke scored a double against Roma . The 4-0 win sees Chelsea U19s progress to the UEFA Youth League final . TL;DR Manchester United beat West Ham 3-1 in their FA Cup fourth-round tie at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.",

      "premise": "The UK should not prioritise making trade deals around the world at the expense of maintaining close ties with the European Union following Brexit, the government has been warned. The Institute of Directors, one of the country’s top business lobby groups with more than 30,000 members, said ministers would need to boost trade with both the EU and the rest of the world to make their “global Britain” ambitions a reality. It comes as Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, looks to strike more trade deals with the rest of the world – seen as one of the key reasons among prominent Brexiters for leaving the EU. However, polling of almost 800 company directors by the IoD found the EU has provided stronger growth for British firms selling goods overseas than Asia or North America over the past two years. Business leaders see potential in these regions in the next five years, according to the poll, but the EU remains the area with the highest expectations for growth. More than two out of five company bosses found most business growth in the EU, compared with one in five citing North America or Asia. Two thirds of those polled exported goods, up by 7% on 2013. Allie Renison of the IoD warned ministers to “get real about trade, and fast” as the statistics showed how important the EU was for British firms. “Going global is as much about opportunities in Europe as it is further afield, and this should be reflected in how the government shapes post-Brexit Britain,” she said. A separate study found that three out of four companies are optimistic about their international business prospects. A survey of more than 6,000 firms by HSBC showed mixed feeling about the impact of Brexit, with 38% saying it will be negative, while a third predicted it would be positive. Amanda Murphy, the head of commercial banking for HSBC UK, said: “Undeterred by future post-EU uncertainty, businesses clearly aim to capitalise on the cheaper pound and rising demand in key markets to boost their overseas sales.”",
