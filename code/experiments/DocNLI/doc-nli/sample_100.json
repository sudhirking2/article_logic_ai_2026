Over the past five years , airline passengers have left behind more than $ 2.7 million in quarters and dimes . And the funds collected appear to be increasing every year , according to figures from the Transportation Security Administration . The funds collected by the TSA appear to be increasing every year , according to figures from the Transportation Security Administration . Last year the TSA were allowed to keep $ 675,000 in spare change - almost double what was collected in 2008 at $ 383,414 , . The sum was $ 107,000 more than what passengers left behind in 2012 , and more than $ 150,000 than 2011 . According to federal law , if no one comes back to claim the money the TSA are allowed to keep it . The agency is then free to spend anything they feel will improve the civil aviation security . TSA officials said the agency 'makes every effort to reunite passengers with items left at the checkpoint , however there are instances where loose change or other items are left behind and unclaimed . The TSA got to keep $ 675,000 in spare change left behind by travellers at airport security last year . 'Unclaimed money , typically consisting of loose coins passengers remove from their pockets , is documented and turned into the TSA financial office , ' the agency said in a statement . In 2005 , Congress gave the agency the ability to use the forgotten money to help fund security operations . Some airports , such as Phoenix and Columbus , Ohio , and Denver International Airport , offer travellers the opportunity to donate money to local charities at collection boxes at checkpoints . According to federal law , if no one comes back to claim the money it stays with the TSA .",

      "premise": "( CNN ) About 150,000 years ago -- give or take 20,000 -- a guy fell into a well . Last month he made science history . The Altamura Man became the oldest Neanderthal to have his DNA extracted by researchers . It took them more than 20 years to get around to doing it . Scientists in southern Italy have known about him since 1993 , when spelunkers spied his skull staring blankly back at them from its nook in the Lamalunga cave , deep under the town of Altamura . The cave explorers told researchers at the University of Bari what they 'd found , according to their report published in March in the Journal of Human Evolution and Phys.org . Altamura Man 's intact skull and jumbled pile of bones made for a great specimen , but they were wedged into a panoply of stalactites and stony globules deposited by water dripping over them for tens of thousands of years . Researchers decided not to rescue the bones for fear that trying to ease them out of the cave 's calcified grip would shatter them and ruin Altamura Man . So , they left him forever a cave man . Calcite pebbles line the Neanderthal 's eye sockets , nose bone and an upper jaw like a hundred decorative piercings . Analysis of the calcite has shown the bones to be 128,000 to 187,000 years old . Scientists believe Altamura Man wound up in the cave at least that long ago after falling into a prehistoric well , then died in the caverns at its bottom of thirst or hunger . Recently , researchers made an exception , and toted off a chip from his right shoulder blade to the lab . Metrics taken of his skeleton confirm Altamura Man was a Homo neanderthalensis . He will spend perhaps endless eons glaring silently out of his cranny in the world 's most secluded spot , or , as Altamura 's archeological museum describes it , `` in the corner of a small cavity situated between the ground and the back wall . '' The scientists hope they will be able to sequence his DNA , to find out more about the evolution of all hominids -- including us . And to hear some of Altamura Man 's story about life in Neanderthals ' early days in Europe , before he happened to stumble into that darned hole .",

      "premise": "Last week Gatecoin, a digital currency exchange company based in Hong Kong, suffered a security breach that resulted in the loss of 250 bitcoin and 185,000 etherium. This loss is the equivalent of $2 million, or 15% of the total assets held by Gatecoin. In the official statement posted on their website, Gatecoin stated that they had a disruption of service last Monday that resulted in a server reboot, and on Friday noticed suspicious transactions. After an immediate suspension of services, and a forensic investigation by French cybersecurity firm Tehtri Security, Gatecoin confirms that the breach occurred and resulted in a drastic loss of assets. Gatecoin services will be offline until May 28, at which time customers may access their accounts and, if they choose, withdraw their funds using a new platform specifically designed for secure withdrawals. The company is also attempting to raise funds to cover customer losses and intends to reimburse their customers for funds lost in the hack. The use of segregated accounts was touted by Gatecoin as a method to reduce risk and exposure to hackers, a concern when dealing in digital currencies. However, in the security breach the hacker altered the system so that the multi-sig cold storage system was bypassed, and funds were transmitted directly to a hot wallet. There is a 5% limit on hot wallets, but due to the multi-sig bypass, transfers were allowed to exceed that limit. Hot wallet exchanges are different from offline storage, or ‘cold wallet’ hacks, such as the February attack on Chinese firm Bter that resulted in a similar, almost $2 million loss. Hot wallet exchanges are hidden inside active traffic, making them harder to detect immediately. Gatecoin has requested help in tracking the ‘malicious external entities’ responsible for the breach, and to that end have posted the wallet addresses used by the hackers on their website. As a result of the weaknesses in their system that have been exposed, Gatecoin is planning a move to a new infrastructure before services resume. They have assured their customers that remaining assets are secure. Aurélien Menant, CEO of Gatecoin added, “We sincerely apologize for all the concern experienced by our clients and for the inconvenience caused while clients wait for their fund withdrawals to be processed. Gatecoin would also like to express our gratitude to the community of exchanges that have very kindly volunteered to help identify the parties responsible for the stolen funds.”",

      "premise": "The database of the Philippine Commission on Elections (COMELEC) has been breached and the personal information of 55 million voters potentially exposed in what could rank as the worst ever government data breach anywhere. The website of COMELEC was compromised on 27 March by Anonymous, before LulzSec Pilipinas stuck the database online days later. It’s believed Anonymous’ motivation was to persuade the commission to switch on security features in the vote counting machines ahead of national elections on 9 May. According to Trend Micro, which has a threat research center in the Philippines, COMELEC’s statement that there was no sensitive info in the database, is wide of the mark. “Our research showed that massive records of PII, including fingerprints data were leaked. Included in the data COMELEC deemed public was a list of COMELEC officials that have admin accounts,” the firm said in a blog post. “Based on our investigation, the data dumps include 1.3 million records of overseas Filipino voters, which included passport numbers and expiry dates. What is alarming is that this crucial data is just in plain text and accessible to everyone. Interestingly, we also found a whopping 15.8 million records of fingerprints and a list of people running for office since the 2010 elections.” Trend Micro warned that voters could be targeted in phishing or spear phishing attacks, BEC schemes, blackmail, extortion and more. It added that the incident highlights once again the need for organizations to classify, segregate and protect data based on its sensitivity – under the watchful eye of a data protection officer. “It will be crucial for companies to employ data protection officers, but even then it will be an uphill battle for various reasons, including cultural differences,” argued Trend Micro CTO, Raimund Genes. “For example, In Germany, having a Data Protection Officer is necessary by law, but in other countries, it’s not. Companies might even think that they don’t need one.” Regular security audits, user education, patching and breach contingency plans will all lower the chances of a breach and/or mitigate its effects. If true, the 55 million figure – which amounts to every single registered voter in the Southeast Asian nation – will dwarf the United States OPM breach last year, which affected over 21 million government employees.",

      "premise": "A majority of UK workers believe disadvantaged young people find it harder to progress in the workplace today than their contemporaries did two generations ago, according to research commissioned by the former education secretary Justine Greening. The study, undertaken by the Social Mobility Pledge initiative founded by Greening, suggests the majority of UK workers believe young people can face a “class ceiling” in attempting to secure jobs and promotions. The research says 60% of workers aged 35 to 64 believe economically disadvantaged people in the generation below them have a harder time progressing in their careers than those from the generation above. Greening said it indicated that workplaces for the baby boomer generation may have been more accommodating of class differences than millennials in the workplace today. The poll of 2,000 people also found the majority of workers aged 18 to 64 found progressing as a disadvantaged young person was either “difficult” or “very difficult”, rising from 54% nationally to 62% in London. Greening, who was born in Rotherham and has described experiencing unemployment in her family as a youngster, said the findings suggested class diversity at work may be regressing from generation to generation. “This is hugely concerning, given that the UK already has such a poor record in terms of social mobility,” she said. “Enabling people to get on in life regardless of their background drives prosperity in local communities, businesses and the national economy. This really is a defining issue facing the UK currently and employers in all sectors have a central role to play in solving it.” Greening set up the Social Mobility Pledge after resigning from Theresa May’s cabinet last year following a bid to move her from the education brief to the Department for Work and Pensions. The MP, who has a slim majority in her Putney seat in south-west London, has indicated she may be keen to run as a candidate in a Tory leadership election from the party’s progressive wing, which is also likely to include the current work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd. Greening, a supporter of a second EU referendum, has been outspoken previously about the limited offer that Tories have for young, working-class voters. She has suggested she had intended to scrap tuition fees in favour of a graduate contribution scheme, because of concerns tuition fees of £9,250 per year could start to put off poorer students. The pledge encourages employers to set up links with local schools and colleges, offer apprenticeships and adopt open recruitment policies such as name-blind or “contextual” recruitment. John Lewis, Marks & Spencer and ITV are among the organisations that have signed up.",

      "premise": "A bizarre performance from Stan Wawrinka saw Grigor Dimitrov breeze through 6-1 , 6-2 to his first masters quarter-final of the season . Wawrinka is the defending champion in Monte Carlo and seldom has a title been relinquished so easily . The Swiss No 2 played like he was in a hurry - and not in a good way . Rushing between points , Wawrinka won the first of the match and then made four unforced errors in a row to surrender his serve . Grigor Dimitrov powers a forehand from the back court in his comfortable win over Stan Wawrinka . Wawrinka , the Monte Carlo Masters defending champion , appeared out of sorts in the 6-1 6-2 defeat . The world No 9 looked listless and disinterested , rolling in 95mph first serves and ballooning groundstrokes long . He did not appear to be injured but something was very clearly wrong ; four winners and 41 unforced errors can not be put down merely to a bad day at the office . Wawrinka 's coach Magnus Norman is not in Monte Carlo this week and , watching at home , he may have been glad of the opportunity to turn off the television . Dimitrov moves through to the quarter-finals where the Bulgarian will meet Frenchman Gael Monfils . Wawrinka was n't at his finest as he failed to get on the board in the match until the fifth game . In the second , Wawrinka played a little better - he could scarcely have played worse - but still gave Dimitrov a generous helping of mistakes . The world No 11 broke early and Wawrinka served to stay in the match at 5-2 down . Four tame unforced errors later and Dimitrov was through to the last eight . The crowd on court central would have expected a thrilling encounter between two of the most expressive players on tour . Instead , they were treated to an abject and mystifying performance from Wawrinka . The 30-year-old finally got on the board in the fifth game of the match , although this was down more to errors from Dimitrov - who was n't even playing especially well himself - than any improvement from the Swiss . But the Bulgarian broke for a third time and closed out the first set 6-1 . Dimitrov and a disappointed Wawrinka shake hands at the end of the quickfire encounter .",

The integration aims to help trading desks and media buyers who use Adelphic’s DSP to access large audiences with in-feed display and video placements across mobile sites and apps on the Sharethrough Exchange through Adelphic’s self-serve native workflow. The deal combines Adelphic’s mobile ad expertise with Sharethrough’s publisher network. It will comply with the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s OpenRTB 2.3 specification that standardized the component parts for the real-time trading of native ads. Adelphic is known in the mobile and cross-channel advertising spaces for developing patented technology that overcomes the limits of user identification in mobile and across channels. Its technology aims to break down billions of data points to help brands better understand which customers they’re talking to on mobile platforms. advertisement advertisement Sharethrough said Adelphic is the first DSP to allow third-party buyers to purchase native video placements on the Sharethrough Exchange programmatically. “Integrating with a vertical DSP like Adelphic shows how much the programmatic native market has matured,” Alex White, VP product marketing at Sharethrough, told Real-Time Daily via email. White hinted that he expects more integrations in 2017 to support in-feed native video programmatically. Sharethrough reported $140 million in native ad spend running through its platform in 2016. More than 75% of the impressions served through the Sharethrough Exchange in Q3 2016 were on mobile devices, with 77% of that inventory from the mobile Web. Sharethrough also said mobile native ads present unique requirements, as the units’ dimensions need to be optimized for with click-through rates that can be as much as three times higher than desktop ads. But they also have lower viewability rates than desktop equivalents — 24% viewability on mobile vs. 38% on desktop, according to the company’s data. Native video on mobile is projected to exceed $20 billion in ad spend in 2017, according to Business Insider Intelligence.",

June's increase followed a rise of 9.1 billion yuan in May. As the Chinese currency is not freely convertible under the capital account, the central bank has to purchase foreign currency generated by China's trade surplus and foreign investment in the country, adding funds to the money market. Such funds are an important indicator of cross-border foreign capital flows and domestic yuan liquidity. An increase in the funds usually signals eased capital flight pressure, while a decrease often means higher capital flight pressure. China's foreign exchange reserves remained relatively stable at US$3.1121 trillion at the end of June, up 0.05 percent from May, earlier data showed. \"China has ample foreign exchange reserves and relatively large room for policy controls.

This loss is the equivalent of $2 million, or 15% of the total assets held by Gatecoin. In the official statement posted on their website, Gatecoin stated that they had a disruption of service last Monday that resulted in a server reboot, and on Friday noticed suspicious transactions. After an immediate suspension of services, and a forensic investigation by French cybersecurity firm Tehtri Security, Gatecoin confirms that the breach occurred and resulted in a drastic loss of assets. Gatecoin services will be offline until May 28, at which time customers may access their accounts and, if they choose, withdraw their funds using a new platform specifically designed for secure withdrawals. The company is also attempting to raise funds to cover customer losses and intends to reimburse their customers for funds lost in the hack. The use of segregated accounts was touted by Gatecoin as a method to reduce risk and exposure to hackers, a concern when dealing in digital currencies. However, in the security breach the hacker altered the system so that the multi-sig cold storage system was bypassed, and funds were transmitted directly to a hot wallet. There is a 5% limit on hot wallets, but due to the multi-sig bypass, transfers were allowed to exceed that limit. Hot wallet exchanges are different from offline storage, or ‘cold wallet’ hacks, such as the February attack on Chinese firm Bter that resulted in a similar, almost $2 million loss. Hot wallet exchanges are hidden inside active traffic, making them harder to detect immediately. Gatecoin has requested help in tracking the ‘malicious external entities’ responsible for the breach, and to that end have posted the wallet addresses used by the hackers on their website. As a result of the weaknesses in their system that have been exposed, Gatecoin is planning a move to a new infrastructure before services resume. They have assured their customers that remaining assets are secure. Aurélien Menant, CEO of Gatecoin added, “We sincerely apologize for all the concern experienced by our clients and for the inconvenience caused while clients wait for their fund withdrawals to be processed.

      "premise": "Last week Gatecoin, a digital currency exchange company based in Hong Kong, suffered a security breach that resulted in the loss of 250 bitcoin and 185,000 etherium. This loss is the equivalent of $2 million, or 15% of the total assets held by Gatecoin. In the official statement posted on their website, Gatecoin stated that they had a disruption of service last Monday that resulted in a server reboot, and on Friday noticed suspicious transactions. After an immediate suspension of services, and a forensic investigation by French cybersecurity firm Tehtri Security, Gatecoin confirms that the breach occurred and resulted in a drastic loss of assets. Gatecoin services will be offline until May 28, at which time customers may access their accounts and, if they choose, withdraw their funds using a new platform specifically designed for secure withdrawals. The company is also attempting to raise funds to cover customer losses and intends to reimburse their customers for funds lost in the hack. The use of segregated accounts was touted by Gatecoin as a method to reduce risk and exposure to hackers, a concern when dealing in digital currencies. However, in the security breach the hacker altered the system so that the multi-sig cold storage system was bypassed, and funds were transmitted directly to a hot wallet. There is a 5% limit on hot wallets, but due to the multi-sig bypass, transfers were allowed to exceed that limit. Hot wallet exchanges are different from offline storage, or ‘cold wallet’ hacks, such as the February attack on Chinese firm Bter that resulted in a similar, almost $2 million loss. Hot wallet exchanges are hidden inside active traffic, making them harder to detect immediately. Gatecoin has requested help in tracking the ‘malicious external entities’ responsible for the breach, and to that end have posted the wallet addresses used by the hackers on their website. As a result of the weaknesses in their system that have been exposed, Gatecoin is planning a move to a new infrastructure before services resume. They have assured their customers that remaining assets are secure. Aurélien Menant, CEO of Gatecoin added, “We sincerely apologize for all the concern experienced by our clients and for the inconvenience caused while clients wait for their fund withdrawals to be processed. Gatecoin would also like to express our gratitude to the community of exchanges that have very kindly volunteered to help identify the parties responsible for the stolen funds.”",

      "premise": "The database of the Philippine Commission on Elections (COMELEC) has been breached and the personal information of 55 million voters potentially exposed in what could rank as the worst ever government data breach anywhere. The website of COMELEC was compromised on 27 March by Anonymous, before LulzSec Pilipinas stuck the database online days later. It’s believed Anonymous’ motivation was to persuade the commission to switch on security features in the vote counting machines ahead of national elections on 9 May. According to Trend Micro, which has a threat research center in the Philippines, COMELEC’s statement that there was no sensitive info in the database, is wide of the mark. “Our research showed that massive records of PII, including fingerprints data were leaked. Included in the data COMELEC deemed public was a list of COMELEC officials that have admin accounts,” the firm said in a blog post. “Based on our investigation, the data dumps include 1.3 million records of overseas Filipino voters, which included passport numbers and expiry dates. What is alarming is that this crucial data is just in plain text and accessible to everyone. Interestingly, we also found a whopping 15.8 million records of fingerprints and a list of people running for office since the 2010 elections.” Trend Micro warned that voters could be targeted in phishing or spear phishing attacks, BEC schemes, blackmail, extortion and more. It added that the incident highlights once again the need for organizations to classify, segregate and protect data based on its sensitivity – under the watchful eye of a data protection officer. “It will be crucial for companies to employ data protection officers, but even then it will be an uphill battle for various reasons, including cultural differences,” argued Trend Micro CTO, Raimund Genes. “For example, In Germany, having a Data Protection Officer is necessary by law, but in other countries, it’s not. Companies might even think that they don’t need one.” Regular security audits, user education, patching and breach contingency plans will all lower the chances of a breach and/or mitigate its effects.

      "premise": "A majority of UK workers believe disadvantaged young people find it harder to progress in the workplace today than their contemporaries did two generations ago, according to research commissioned by the former education secretary Justine Greening. The study, undertaken by the Social Mobility Pledge initiative founded by Greening, suggests the majority of UK workers believe young people can face a “class ceiling” in attempting to secure jobs and promotions. The research says 60% of workers aged 35 to 64 believe economically disadvantaged people in the generation below them have a harder time progressing in their careers than those from the generation above. Greening said it indicated that workplaces for the baby boomer generation may have been more accommodating of class differences than millennials in the workplace today. The poll of 2,000 people also found the majority of workers aged 18 to 64 found progressing as a disadvantaged young person was either “difficult” or “very difficult”, rising from 54% nationally to 62% in London. Greening, who was born in Rotherham and has described experiencing unemployment in her family as a youngster, said the findings suggested class diversity at work may be regressing from generation to generation. “This is hugely concerning, given that the UK already has such a poor record in terms of social mobility,” she said. “Enabling people to get on in life regardless of their background drives prosperity in local communities, businesses and the national economy. This really is a defining issue facing the UK currently and employers in all sectors have a central role to play in solving it.” Greening set up the Social Mobility Pledge after resigning from Theresa May’s cabinet last year following a bid to move her from the education brief to the Department for Work and Pensions. The MP, who has a slim majority in her Putney seat in south-west London, has indicated she may be keen to run as a candidate in a Tory leadership election from the party’s progressive wing, which is also likely to include the current work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd. Greening, a supporter of a second EU referendum, has been outspoken previously about the limited offer that Tories have for young, working-class voters. She has suggested she had intended to scrap tuition fees in favour of a graduate contribution scheme, because of concerns tuition fees of £9,250 per year could start to put off poorer students. The pledge encourages employers to set up links with local schools and colleges, offer apprenticeships and adopt open recruitment policies such as name-blind or “contextual” recruitment. John Lewis, Marks & Spencer and ITV are among the organisations that have signed up.",

The MP, who has a slim majority in her Putney seat in south-west London, has indicated she may be keen to run as a candidate in a Tory leadership election from the party’s progressive wing, which is also likely to include the current work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd. Greening, a supporter of a second EU referendum, has been outspoken previously about the limited offer that Tories have for young, working-class voters. She has suggested she had intended to scrap tuition fees in favour of a graduate contribution scheme, because of concerns tuition fees of £9,250 per year could start to put off poorer students. The pledge encourages employers to set up links with local schools and colleges, offer apprenticeships and adopt open recruitment policies such as name-blind or “contextual” recruitment.

      "premise": "China's yuan funds outstanding for foreign exchange grew each month during the first half of this year, official data showed today. The funds stood at 21.52 trillion yuan (US$3.2 trillion) at the end of June, up by 7.61 billion yuan from a month earlier, according to the People's Bank of China, Xinhua reports. June's increase followed a rise of 9.1 billion yuan in May. As the Chinese currency is not freely convertible under the capital account, the central bank has to purchase foreign currency generated by China's trade surplus and foreign investment in the country, adding funds to the money market. Such funds are an important indicator of cross-border foreign capital flows and domestic yuan liquidity. An increase in the funds usually signals eased capital flight pressure, while a decrease often means higher capital flight pressure. China's foreign exchange reserves remained relatively stable at US$3.1121 trillion at the end of June, up 0.05 percent from May, earlier data showed. \"China has ample foreign exchange reserves and relatively large room for policy controls. China is capable and confident in coping with all sorts of challenges,\" said Wang Chunying, spokesperson for the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, at a press conference today.",

These funds are a significant indicator of cross-border foreign capital flows and domestic yuan liquidity, and so any increase generally means eased capital flight pressure.",
