      "premise": "The synthesis of urea by Friedrich Wöhler opened a new research field, organic chemistry, and by the end of the 19th century, scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds. The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth's petrochemicals, after the exhaustion of the oil supply from whaling. By the 20th century, systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic materials for clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources. Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in physiological chemistry, the precursor to biochemistry. The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. Linus Pauling's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling's work culminated in the physical modelling of DNA, the secret of life (in the words of Francis Crick, 1953). In the same year, the Miller–Urey experiment demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple amino acids, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules.",

      "premise": "A year ago, Lyft introduced a new way to pay its drivers designed to get them on the road more often. Drivers who clocked over 30 hours (at least a third of them designated peak hours) could get an additional 10 percent in commission on top of the 80 cents on the dollar Lyft usually pays. Drivers who logged 50 or more hours could get 20 percent more, the full cost of the ride. Yesterday, the ride-hailing startup quietly tweaked the formula. The program, called Power Driver Bonus, now doles out bonuses based on the rides drivers make rather than hours driven. So if a driver clocks 100 rides a week, 30 of them during peak hours, she gets the full price of the ride. A Lyft rep confirmed the change, noting that it is designed to give drivers more flexibility. Here’s another reason, one that Lyft probably won’t say out loud: Some crafty drivers were finding loopholes, securing bonuses without the additional mileage. Drivers would log into the app but not make a pick-up, according to a few drivers Re/code spoke with. Or they would select a pick-up then stall, waiting for the rider to cancel, netting the hours but not the gas toll — or the ride. (The Power Bonus program requires that drivers maintain a 90 percent acceptance rate.) That said, drivers do tend to cite flexibility and bonus opportunities as reasons for favoring Lyft over larger rival Uber. Lyft said it has paid out $22 million to drivers so far through the program, which is expanding in three cities. That’s not a massive amount. But if we take its financials as reported by Bloomberg — $46.7 million in revenue, after paying out drivers, for the first half of the year — that’s roughly akin to a fourth of its annual sales. Quite a sum to keep drivers from spending more time with Uber. Yesterday, the Seattle city council approved a measure allowing drivers for both startups to unionize. This article originally appeared on Recode.net.",
      "hypothesis": "It would seem that Lyft’s old bonus scheme, which offered more money based on the number of hours a driver clocks, was a bit too easy to manipulate, and as such the ride-sharing company has been forced to rethink its bonus strategy. Lyft is now awarding bonuses based on the number of rides a driver makes instead, which is obviously much harder to falsify. According to Re-Code, under the new scheme, drivers will get 20 percent of their earnings if they complete 100 rides per week, with 30 of those rides accomplished during peak hours. Previously, Lyft would forego taking its commission from drivers who clocked up 50 hours per week, however this allowed drivers to log into the app to accumulate hours even if they had no intention of picking anybody up. The new system will obviously be better for Lyft’s bottom line, but also for clients as it translates to more “real” rides actually available on the roads.",

It’s a hands-off and hassle free investment that also yields a 25% asset appreciation. If ever there was a good time to invest in New York office space...now would be the time. The financial benefits of this investment opportunity don’t just stop at with the investor. The office space being offered is rented to co-workers, a fast growing work space and office sharing concept. As noted by the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics, when projecting ahead to 2020, “65 million Americans will be freelancers, temps, independent contractors and solopreneurs, making up about 40% of the workforce”. Although office sharing is not a new concept, what is innovative with these new office spaces is that the tenant gets an all-in fixed fee, meaning no hidden extra charges each month. This means the tenant will get free services like coffee, photocopying, phone, reduced price drinks and much more. If this wasn’t enough, the investor, too, gets a free lifetime membership and can also use the office and conference facilities whenever they want; this will include other venues earmarked for future development such as London.The U.S Real Estate Investment MarketInvestor confidence remains very high in U.S. real estate, and indeed New York in particular, according to a recent study conducted by the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate. Of course, investor confidence was low globally in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crises, with about $5 billion worth of investments made in U.S. real estate in 2009; but now the story is very different. The figures for 2015 have recorded an impressive $87.3 billion worth of investments in U.S real estate, with just over $23.5 billion or 27% of the share being claimed by New York alone, according to data supplied by Real Capital Analytics.

      "premise": "BSP Gov. Nestor Espenilla INQUIRER file photo The smallest banks in the Philippines can play a key role in bringing financial services — and thus, an easier path toward economic improvement — to some of the remotest parts of the country, many of which have no access to the most basic banking services. In a speech on Monday, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Nestor Espenilla Jr. urged rural banks to leverage their benefits of technology to bring more Filipinos into the formal financial system, especially those in far-flung areas that larger firms cannot serve. “There is much scope for expansion towards countryside development, [as] 554 cities and municipalities, or almost a third of the total, in the country are still unbanked as of December 2017,” the central bank chief said at the annual convention of the Rural Bankers Association of the Philippines (RBAP) in Davao City. He also pointed out that only 34.5 percent of Filipino adults have formal accounts, ranging from bank deposits to e-money accounts, according to the World Bank’s 2017 Global Findex. “Given RBAP’s strategic role and familiarity with rural communities, it is crucial for the industry to leverage on innovative technologies and liberalized branching rules that BSP has initiated,” he said. “This will further expand market reach and enhance existing service delivery channels in the rural areas.” Rural banks comprise the smallest segment of the country’s banking industry, with the sector’s assets reaching only P250.7 billion at end-December 2017, representing 1.6 percent of total system-wide assets. Espenilla noted, however, that this sector’s network of 2,745 banking offices nationwide makes it “strategically positioned to be a catalyst for greater financial inclusion.” “[Rural banks’] close ties and familiarity with the rural communities you serve make you effective providers of rural financing and other corollary microfinance products and services,” he said, adding that almost 97 percent of the industry’s network is spread across provinces. More importantly, the central bank chief noted that rural banks enjoy public trust and confidence as evidenced by the industry’s deposit profile where accounts maintaining less than P10,000 make up 87.3 percent of their retail depositors. Espenilla urged rural banks to take advantage of available technology to become a strong and dependable delivery channel in the provision of banking services to the countryside. In particular, “fintech” has shown great potential to transform financial services given the country’s young demographic profile, he said, urging the banks’ leaders to adopt more digital technology.

      "premise": "India’s startups raised a record $10.5 billion in funding last year from dozens of international and local investors. When they are in need for capital again, they will have an additional source to look at: Microsoft. Microsoft announced today that it is expanding the reach of its M12 corporate venture fund (formerly known as Microsoft Ventures) to India, and also unveiled its first investment in the country: Innovaccer, a six-year-old SaaS startup that is working to solve data interoperability challenges in healthcare systems to improve their clinical and financial outcomes. Neither party revealed financial terms of the investment. Microsoft has appointed Rashmi Gopinath, a partner with the venture fund, to lead the initiative in India. Gopinath said the entity will largely focus on business-to-business startups that work on areas such as big data, cloud infrastructure, AI, security, and analytics. She added that M12 would either lead or co-invest in series A to C rounds and make investments of between $2 million and $10 million. This is promising news for early-stage startups in India that have struggled to turn heads and secure capital in recent years, analysts VentureBeat spoke with earlier this month said. In a statement, Nagraj Kashyap, global head of M12 and corporate vice president at Microsoft, said, “In working with these innovative startups, we believe together we will help disrupt enterprises and industries ripe for digital transformation.” Innovaccer, which has offices in India and the U.S., offers a health care data platform and intelligent care application modules for over 10,000 health care providers across 500 practice locations. It uses machine learning to allow its users to consolidate their financial, patient, and operational data and form a 360-view for better decision-making, care coordination, and reporting. It counts Mercy ACO, UC San Diego, and Osler Health among its clients. The arrival of M12, which includes VCs and several veterans of the company, in India comes as the nation attracts billions of dollars from Chinese and South African investors, as well as Google and Amazon. Of the $10.5 billion Indian startups raised last year, the country’s largest ecommerce platform Flipkart’s acquisition by Walmart for $16 billion was the biggest highlight. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has also made an investment in Byju’s, an Indian edtech startup, which just happens to be in the news today.

      "premise": "Ofcom has fined Royal Mail a record £50m for breaching competition law. The fine is for its actions in 2014 when Whistl, which was then known as TNT, was trying to become its first competitor in wholesale mail delivery. The regulator's investigation, which followed a complaint by Whistl, said Royal Mail had abused its dominant market position and discriminated against the company. Whistl is seeking damages, but Royal Mail said it will challenge the fine. Ofcom's investigation found that Royal Mail price rises in 2014 meant any of its wholesale customers such as Whistl that wanted to compete with it would have to pay higher prices in the remaining areas where it used Royal Mail for delivery. Ofcom's investigation found that Royal Mail's actions amounted to \"anti-competitive discrimination against customers, such as Whistl, who sought to deliver bulk mail\". Jonathan Oxley, Ofcom's competition director, said: \"Royal Mail broke the law by abusing its dominant position in bulk mail delivery. \"All companies must play by the rules. Royal Mail's behaviour was unacceptable, and it denied postal users the potential benefits that come from effective competition.\" Royal Mail said it was \"very disappointed\" by Ofcom's decision and \"strongly refutes any suggestion\" that it had breached the Competition Act, adding: \"The decision is without merit and fundamentally flawed.\" It said the price changes were designed to protect the Universal Service, which, unlike its competitors, it was required to continue providing. The Universal Service means post is charged at the same rate, regardless of where it is sent to across the UK. Royal Mail said Ofcom's chief role was to prevent rivals from picking off the profitable, usually urban, deliveries. A spokesperson for Whistl said it would review the Ofcom findings and determine the level of damages to seek from Royal Mail. \"Initial advice is that Royal Mail is potentially liable to pay compensation for the significant damage that was caused to Whistl's business, in addition to the fine imposed by Ofcom.\" Royal Mail said there were major problems with Whistl's direct delivery business model and it did not believe potential claims for damages from the firm had any legal basis. \"No damages claims are payable until the appeals process is exhausted. We are confident that Ofcom's decision will be overturned,\" a spokesperson said. Analysts at Liberum said even if the fine was upheld, it would not affect Royal Mail's profits - but could limit its expansion. \"Although the fine itself is not material, and the competitor that brought the complaint has long since withdrawn from the market, we see broader potential implications. \"Importantly, we believe this is a reminder that Royal Mail must act with restraint given its dominant market shares in both letters and parcels, and this limits the group's ability to grow parcels revenue over the long term.\" After rising in morning trading, Royal Mail shares were down 1.4% to 455.7p in the afternoon, valuing the company at £4.6bn.",

      "premise": "Google has introduced a new payment app in India called Tez (the Hindi word for “fast”). Tez features a technology called audio QR that allows users to transfer money using sounds to pair two devices. Called the “cash mode option,” phones negotiate a connection using audio to identify the payer and payee. (The sounds should be inaudible to human ears though because they’re sent using ultrasonic frequencies, according to the Financial Times.) The feature is therefore similar to cash transactions which don’t require the exchange of personal details like bank accounts and phone numbers. Cash Mode works with any phone with a mic and speaker and Tez app installed, and doesn’t require an NFC chip. Google’s Audio QR technology is similar to Chirp, which also sends data encoded in ultrasonic audio. There are 300 million smartphone users in India, and phones with NFC are still relatively rare and expensive, with many users instead favoring entry-level and mid-tier devices. Tez is a step beyond Android Pay, because it allows users to link payment apps from Indian banks — it works with all of the country’s 55 banks on India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI). UPI is a system that allows numerous bank accounts to be linked into one mobile app, and enables secure peer-to-peer payment. According to Bloomberg, digital transactions have surged after the Indian Government banned high-value cash notes late last year. Tez also facilitates bank-to-bank payments and is protected by Tez Shield, a data security platform from Google that detects fraud and protects user identity. Tez behaves like a chat app, using your contact list as a way to keep transaction history organized. People or businesses you’ve sent or received cash from grouped together “like a conversation,” Google says. The company says small businesses can also use the app to accept payments into their bank accounts, and it also accepts payments from mobile sites with “just a few taps.” Tez is available on both Android and iOS, and Google plans to release the app in other emerging countries including Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand.",

Tipton Community School Corp. is the latest school district to ensure students don’t miss crucial instructional time ahead of next spring’s ISTEP standardized exam testing period. The district that’s about 40 miles north of Indianapolis has been holding “eLearning” days this fall to familiarize students and staff with the technology-dependent learning format before winter arrives. The last two Indiana winters have been harsh, and many districts extended their school years to make up for days lost to ice, snow or frigid temperatures. Online technology allows students to access their assignments virtually, complete them at their own pace and communicate with their teachers electronically. The district hopes to call eLearning days to replace actual classroom time if bad weather keeps kids at home this winter, the Kokomo Tribune reported. “One of the things we talk about is anytime, anywhere learning,” said Tipton schools technology director Brian Witherow. Students in Patti Herron’s class at Tipton Elementary School spent a recent morning reading in small groups and occasionally asking her questions, using their iPads to communicate as part of their training. Herron’s students have virtual access to her on each eLearning day, meaning they can ask her questions through a chat program and she can send out reminders about assignments needing to be completed. Fifth-grader Drew Stillson said he enjoys using his iPad for online learning. “It’s kind of easier typing it instead of writing it,” he said. “It’s a lot more fun. You get to do a lot of apps instead of doing worksheets or books.” Tipton High School Principal Joe Rushton said the increased focus on eLearning will better prepare students for college, where they will have to take more responsibility for managing their time and completing assignments on their own. “The way we’re looking at traditional school has to change with the times,” he said. Similar to Tipton’s approach to eLearning this year, Maconaquah School Corp. also schedules eLearning days throughout the year and uses them in case of inclement. The district has been a leader in the state. Last winter, Northwestern School Corp. and Western School Corp. decided to call eLearning days instead of completely canceling school when bad weather hit. Taylor Community School Corp. and Eastern Howard School Corp. also hold eLearning days on Saturdays to make up for previous snow days. Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1Lq08S2",

      "premise": "Although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship. Harold C. Schonberg believes that Chopin displayed a \"tinge of jealousy and spite\" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano, and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success. Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 Études, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\" However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\". Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with George Sand.",

The company raised an additional $9.85 million in its series B round, GeekWire has learned, bringing the total funding in that round to $16.8 million.

Phytelligence declined to name investors in the most recent funding. The startup has now raised a total of $22.5 million since it spun out from Washington State University (WSU) in 2012. It has also more than doubled its headcount in the past year to 150 employees. Phytelligence’s tree cultivation process, based on technology developed by WSU professor Dr. Amit Dhingra, helps fruit trees grow quickly to the size needed before they can be planted in orchards. Instead of traditional soil mixes, Phytelligence grows the trees in a nutritious gel substance that makes the process cheaper and faster. The company has expanded into a variety of fruit markets, but it is also battling a legal dispute with WSU over its rights to grow and sell a lucrative new brand of apples called Cosmic Crisp. When asked about the status of that battle, a company spokesperson said Phytelligence is “continuing to work directly with WSU to identify a mutually beneficial resolution.” Phytelligence was founded by Dhingra, who still serves as its chief science officer.

      "premise": "The morning after the election, the major candidates were neck and neck. It was clear that the result in Ohio, along with two other states who had still not declared (New Mexico and Iowa), would decide the winner. Bush had established a lead of around 130,000 votes but the Democrats pointed to provisional ballots that had yet to be counted, initially reported to number as high as 200,000. Bush had preliminary leads of less than 5% of the vote in only four states, but if Iowa, Nevada and New Mexico had all eventually gone to Kerry, a win for Bush in Ohio would have created a 269–269 tie in the Electoral College. The result of an electoral tie would cause the election to be decided in the House of Representatives with each state casting one vote, regardless of population. Such a scenario would almost certainly have resulted in a victory for Bush, as Republicans controlled more House delegations. Therefore, the outcome of the election hinged solely on the result in Ohio, regardless of the final totals elsewhere. In the afternoon Ohio's Secretary of State, Ken Blackwell, announced that it was statistically impossible for the Democrats to make up enough valid votes in the provisional ballots to win. At the time provisional ballots were reported as numbering 140,000 (and later estimated to be only 135,000). Faced with this announcement, John Kerry conceded defeat. Had Kerry won Ohio, he would have won the election despite losing the national popular vote by over 3 million votes, a complete reversal of the 2000 election when Bush won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to Al Gore by over 500,000 votes.",

      "premise": "In Valdez, Alaska, the Coast Guard confirmed Saturday that a fresh oil sheen has seeped from the ruptured Exxon Valdez and that a complete cleanup of the damaged tanker is impossible. Later in the day in Juneau, a package of bills aimed at protecting Alaska from another devastating oil spill like the one that fouled Prince William Sound was passed by the state Senate with little trouble. \"Oil is clinging to the tanks inside,\" said Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the federal on-the-scene coordinator. \"What we're getting is that clinging oil mixed with water that causes sheen. \"Unfortunately, it's impossible to completely remove the oil unless you steam-clean the tanker, and nobody intends to do that,\" Robbins said. Robbins did not give an estimate of how widespread the oil sheen, or shininess on the water's surface, had become. Time-Consuming Repairs He said he doubted the vessel, which is undergoing temporary repairs 30 miles from the March 24 site where the Exxon Valdez ruptured on a reef, will be moved soon. \"I'm estimating at least a month to six weeks,\" he said. \"Obviously, this (ship) is a hot potato. Nobody in the Lower 48 (states) wants it. We may end up going to a foreign port.\" Reacting to the largest oil spill in the nation's history, the Republican-led Senate acted with unusual speed to move the six bills through the chamber and to the House. However, it appeared unlikely that the Democrat-controlled House would approve the entire package before adjournment, which is scheduled for May 9. 11-Million-Gallon Spill The Senate action came five weeks after the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef, spewing more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into the fish- and wildlife-rich sound. The Senate bills would increase civil fines for spill damage; impose a surcharge on oil producers to boost the state's spill-response fund; prevent oil companies from deducting spill costs from their oil-production taxes; require the state to create spill contingency plans; establish a spill-response office and cleanup corps, and create a commission to investigate the Exxon Valdez spill. More Bills Pending More than a dozen other spill-related bills are still pending in both chambers of the Legislature. Exxon reported Saturday that it has paid out $500,000 to 150 fishermen on claims of lost work. It is processing another 300 claims.",

These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of \"state\" and \"government.\" It was decided that \"state\" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term \"government\" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in political science, although some political scientists, philosophers, historians and cultural anthropologists have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of natural order was not introduced, the social sciences could not evolve independently of theistic thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.",

[Photo/Xinhua] The People's Bank of China, China's central bank, has completed trial runs on the algorithms needed for digital currency supply, taking it a step closer to addressing the technological challenges associated with digital currencies, according to a top official associated with the project. Yao Qian, director-general of the Institute of Digital Money at the PBOC, said China's central bank has successfully designed a prototype that can regulate the supply of its future digital fiat currency. The successful simulation of money supply paves the way for the central bank to become the future sole regulator and policymaker governing the value of digital fiat currency, said Yao. Digital fiat currencies are the digital forms of a sovereign currency that is backed by the central bank. Unlike Bitcoin or other digital money issued by the private sector, the digital fiat currency has the same legal status as the Chinese yuan, the only fiat currency issued by the People's Bank of China. There is no timetable for the introduction of the currency, but once introduced, China is likely to become the first country that would deploy a digital fiat currency. China's central bank has been actively preparing for digital fiat currencies since last year. Earlier in June, the central bank finished several digital money trials involving fake transactions between it and some of the country's commercial banks. \"China has been at the forefront in digital payment technology development,\" said Di Gang, a senior engineer of the institute. \"However, it would still be some time before the currency goes public,\" said Di, adding that, \"the central bank is proceeding very cautiously.\" Apart from solving the technology challenges, there are a number of other concerns that are yet to be solved such as managing risks and improving efficiency, according to Di. The government also needs to factor whether the public would use the new currency, he added. \"The central bank might be able to start trials in some developed regions such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong province, and see how citizens respond to the digital currency,\" he said. The development of a digital currency comes at an opportune time for China, said Yao. The rapid development of the electronic payment sector and thriving private digital currencies have made it imperative for China's central bank to move quickly in digital finance. Looking ahead, deploying the digital fiat currency is expected to be smarter and more intelligent compared to the payment providers using existing currencies, such as Alipay, according to Yao.",

China 's central bank has developed a prototype that can regulate the money supply , paving the way for PBOC to be the future sole source for the value of digital fiat currency , said Yao ##uang , director - general of the Institute of Digital Money at the time . China has no timetable for the introduction of the technology .",

      "premise": "As if Chinese factories weren't already producing enough of our gadgets, chip designer ARM Holdings wants to help Chinese startups produce more wearable devices, robots and smart home products. The U.K. company is setting up an \"accelerator\" in Beijing staffed with experts who can provide Chinese companies with tips on product design including which chips or software to use. It's the first time ARM has created such a program, and its aim is to remove any barriers that might hinder Chinese startups from quickly delivering their products. The country is already home to numerous companies, large and small, developing smartphones, wearables and other connected devices. However, local startups typically possess few resources, and not enough know-how to quickly deliver their products, according to ARM. Some of the challenges they face include selecting the right components, optimizing the device's software, or finding out which operating system best fits their needs. ARM's accelerator program wants to address these challenges, by providing workshops, training and design services relating to the company's own chip designs. The U.K. company is best known for supplying the processor technology used in most smartphone and tablets. But ARM also wants to expand its business into IoT areas such as smart cities, smart homes, and healthcare, where its low-power consuming processors could flourish. Last year, the company announced its mbed platform to help vendors build IoT systems. So it's no surprise that ARM's accelerator in China will also be offering design services around mbed. But on Monday in Beijing, ARM's CEO Simon Segars said that the accelerator will also open itself to other IoT platforms from other companies. The goal is to essentially connect Chinese startups with the appropriate suppliers and vendors, many of whom are already partners with ARM, he added. The accelerator will work through a company ARM has established with Beijing-based Thundersoft, which already specializes in helping smartphone and tablet vendors refine the software on their devices. The accelerator's first office will be based in Beijing, but to reach more startups, four or five other offices will be set up across the country over the next year or so. All Chinese companies are invited to join. The new program will surely help promote ARM's chip designs and software, but it could also assist Chinese vendors in creating successful IoT products, said Kitty Fok, an analyst with research firm IDC. In the future, ARM could even advise these Chinese startups on what opportunities are emerging in the market, or which customers to target, she added.

      "premise": "Demand for secondary places in London will increase by more than a quarter by 2025, with 105,000 extra places needed, the first major forecast for the next decade has found. The research, published today by the Greater London Authority, shows that the capital will need a total of 165,000 more school places over the next 10 years. The study predicts that demand for secondary places will grow by 26.5 per cent – the equivalent of 90 new schools. The research, the first on pupil numbers for the Mayor of London, also forecasts an 8.8 per cent rise in demand for primary places over the same period – an extra 60,000 places. Munira Mirza, London’s deputy mayor for education, said the figures were “sobering” because creating new secondary places was “costlier, slower and more difficult” than expanding primary places. The report will be launched at a conference today, where mayor Boris Johnson will call for London to have a single regional schools commissioner. “A schools commissioner for London is a no-brainer,” Mr Johnson is expected to say. The conference will also discuss separate research for the Mayor of London, published today, which suggests schools should ask headteachers considering retirement to either delay the move or take phased retirement, to curb school leadership shortages in London The study, Building the Leadership Pool in London Schools, warns of a shortage of high-quality heads and points to research conducted earlier this year by education consultancy The Key, which found that nearly six in 10 London headteachers were considering leaving their role in the next three years. A Department for Education spokesman said: “We want every parent to have access to a good school place for their child…That is why we doubled the funding for school places to £5 billion in the last Parliament, creating half a million new places. London has benefited significantly from this, receiving almost £2 billion in the last four years. \"Our Talented Leaders initiative is placing outstanding headteachers into struggling schools, and through programmes like School Direct and Teach First we are helping schools to recruit candidates they may have previously struggled to bring in.” The spokesman added that the current regional schools commissioner structure, in which three RSCs each cover part of the capital as well as a wider region, was “designed to spread excellence into the outlying counties.” This is an edited version of a story in the 27 November edition of TES.

      "premise": "According to findings reported by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG), accountable care organizations (ACOs) participating in the Shared Savings Program are learning how to achieve greater cost savings over time. The Medicare Shared Savings Program is one of the largest alternative payment models implemented by CMS to reward providers for the quality and value of their services in order to keep patients healthy and lower costs. The OIG’s report suggests many positive outcomes of the program, including that one-third of the ACOs that reduced their spending lowered costs enough to receive a portion of the savings. CMS data on quality measures also shows that ACOs generally improved the quality of care they provided, with a rate of 82% performance improvement on the individual quality measures within the first three years of the program. ACOs also outperformed fee-for-service providers on 81% of the quality measures. A small portion of ACOs are reported to have gone above expectations, reducing Medicare spending by an average of $673 per beneficiary, including spending reductions for high-cost services such as inpatient hospital care and skilled nursing facility care. The OIG reports that these high-performing ACOs’ frequent use of primary care services, which can lower utilization and costs for other care, and cost reductions for services such as emergency department visits, was a factor in their cost savings. These strategies are compared to other Shared Savings Program ACOs and the national average for fee‐for‐service providers, who showed an increase in per beneficiary spending for key Medicare services. The OIG concluded that ACOs show promise in reducing Medicare spending while also improving quality. These improvements come at a critical time, as Medicare spending is predicted to grow to $1.4 trillion by 2027. A large portion of Medicare spending has been attributed to overbilling, with the Medicare program losing more money to this error than any other program government-wide.",

The joint-project between St Vincent's Hospital's Aikenhead Centre for Medical Discovery and Melbourne University is looking at the way the arm and brain signals communicate. They have been able to send brain signals to the robotic arm, but now are looking at how to return those signals to give the sensation of touch. Professor Peter Choong from St Vincent's Hospital said these new developments brought hope to amputees. \"It's really very exciting. If you're a patient who has lost a limb or part of a limb, something like this holds out hope for perhaps rebuilding them, allowing them to function much more normally than they do today,\" Professor Choong said. The research has been ongoing for a number of years, but scientists believe they are now even closer to simulating a \"normal\" arm. \"We already have amazing developments in prosthetic limbs, and this research is more about allowing a person to have feel control on that limb, just like it were a normal human limb,\" Professor Choong said. They hope to have the next breakthrough in the next couple of years as they understand how the brain reads and interprets signals. Professor Choong said this latest step was a perfect example of the need for more scientific funding. \"There is a lot to be gained from science, the chief scientific officer's report shows that we contribute considerably to Australia's intellectual and economical wealth, and I think this is an area desperately in need for support from both federal and state governments.\" Topics: health, robots-and-artificial-intelligence, medical-research, disabilities, melbourne-3000, vic First posted May 28, 2016 10:41:19",

While they don't usually get in the way, you still have to be mindful they're there. PKvitality's solution is the K'Track Glucose wearable that uses a so-called SkinTaste sensor and tiny needles to check glucose levels. A removable sensor under the gadget uses a group of 0.5mm needles to collect and analyze the interstitial fluid surrounding tissue cells. Those cells absorb glucose from your bloodstream and can provide a lot of data about what's going on inside of your body. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to to try the K'Track for myself here at CES to compare it to the readings my CGM collects. I did see a working model in action and from start to finish, and the collection and analysis took less than a minute to complete. It's certainly more convenient that a finger stick, but it's tough to say how much added benefit it provides over existing CGMs. The company says it will cost much less, with the tracker priced at $150 and each sensor, which lasts about a month, set at $100. Some quick math tells you that's around $1,350 a year without factoring in things like insurance. What's more, PKvitality has a second version of K'Track that measures lactic acid, heart rate and VO2 max levels during a workout or other physical activity. That K'Track Athlete model is worn on a strap around the arm, much as people wear a phone or music player at the gym. It's more expensive, though, with a price of $200 for the gadget and $150 for each sensor, which also has to be swapped out once per month.

      "premise": "(Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N), which plans a ride-sharing fleet of robotaxis for next year, is looking at further business opportunities for self-driving cars, such as custom designs that could be almost unrecognizable from those of today, a top executive said on Thursday. FILE PHOTO: GM's planned Cruise AV driverless car features no steering wheel or pedals in a still image from video released January 12, 2018. General Motors/Handout via REUTERS Custom-designed vehicles could be owned or leased by individual customers, including those outside of large cities, and used in peer-to-peer car sharing applications, said Mike Abelson, GM’s vice president of global strategy. GM is “thinking about several models” to drive revenue from self-driving cars, according to Abelson, speaking at Citi’s Car of the Future conference in New York. Abelson, one of the key architects of GM’s future transportation business, said self-driving cars used for ride sharing “are going to evolve quickly into purpose-built vehicles” that do not look like conventional cars. While GM initially is using specially modified versions of the Chevrolet Bolt EV for its robotaxi fleet in 2019, the U.S. automaker’s next wave of driverless vehicles will do away with the steering wheel and pedals, and could feature different seating arrangements. The design of the vehicles would be continually adjusted to provide customers with “a more appealing experience,” he said. Others have speculated that hoods could shorten, while passengers sit under a glass bubble. Early leaders in deploying self-driving cars, such as GM and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Waymo, “will have the opportunity to take a lead in new business models that will drive their companies’ profitability,” said John Hoffecker, vice chairman of consultants AlixPartners. Abelson said GM believes personally owned self-driving vehicles “will be a big business in the future,” especially in sparsely populated rural areas where ride sharing may not reach for years. GM’s commercial ride sharing business is expected to drive down the cost of self-driving cars in the future, Abelson said. Affordability is seen as the biggest challenge in extending ownership of self-driving cars to individuals. But they might elect to put their vehicles into a peer-to-peer sharing service, such as those proposed by Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and GM, and share revenue with the companies that operate those services. Hoffecker said costs are “going down dramatically,” to the point where individuals should be able to buy self-driving cars by 2023-25.

She will take up her position in summer 2019 following a non-compete period. De Ricqlès will continue his close relationship with Christie’s as a member of its European Advisory board. Of his time with the company he said: “I am most grateful to François Pinault, whose trust enabled me to embark upon this extraordinary adventure and to the talented teams at Christie’s, in Paris and around the world, as the joint force that spearheaded Christie’s to the forefront of the French auction market. “I recount with pride many marvellous successes: the Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé sale at the Grand Palais in February 2009, the ground-breaking price achieved for the stone head by Modigliani in June 2010, still the most expensive work of art ever sold in France, and the 2016 cultural milestone when we orchestrated the private sale of two portraits by Rembrandt to leading institutions in France and the Netherlands.” François de Ricqlès on the rostrum at Christie’s for the avant-garde sale in 2017.

      "premise": "Biodesix has acquired Seattle-based Integrated Diagnostics and its precommercial XL2 lung cancer blood test, which aims to help physicians rule out the patients that do not need to have a biopsy of a suspicious lung nodule. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Integrated Diagnostics has been actively exploring paths to bring XL2 to the market since it began validating its test last year, said CEO Al Luderer, who cited Biodesix’s focus on noninvasive, blood-based diagnostics for lung disease, as well as its established portfolio of commercial tests, as making it an attractive partner. Biodesix estimates that healthcare providers discover more than 1.6 million suspicious nodules in the U.S. annually, with many of them being referred for biopsies. If the blood test returns as benign, then the patient can have a follow-up CT scan in 3 to 6 months, Biodesix CEO David Brunel told FierceMedTech. Virtual Clinical Trials Online This virtual event will bring together industry experts to discuss the increasing pace of pharmaceutical innovation, the need to maintain data quality and integrity as new technologies are implemented and understand regulatory challenges to ensure compliance. “Right now there’s an increasing number of patients going through screening programs, or through typical procedures that end up finding incidental nodules,” Brunel said. “The problem is that the vast majority of these patients don't have cancer,” he said. “And so rather than overwhelm the healthcare system with a lot of biopsies, it’s very useful to have a test that helps the doctor manage that patient population more effectively.” RELATED: Biodesix brings in $22M in Series F financing to spur immunotherapy test development The XL2 test would ideally complement the tests that Biodesix already has on the market, adding a new point-of-diagnosis product compared to its VeriStrat and GeneStrat proteomic and genomic tests, which are used for therapeutic guidance in typically later-stage patients. A previous clinical trial of the XL2 test showed that, among low- to moderate-risk patients, the test was 98% effective at differentiating benign lung nodules from malignant ones, using proteins found in the bloodstream. Biodesix is planning an additional registry study to further validate the test later this year, expected to enroll around 500 patients, to gauge patient outcomes and changes in physician behavior. “When that study completes, then we'll really ramp up commercialization,” Brunel said.",
      "hypothesis": "Colorado-based Biodesix has acquired Seattle company Integrated Diagnostics in a deal which is set to expand Biodesix's blood-based diagnostics offerings. Integrated Diagnostics has developed XL2, a test which uses proteins in the bloodstream to separately identify benign lung nodules from malignant ones, with a 98% accuracy in a clinical trial. Biodesix, which has a range of complementary tests, is set to bring XL2 to market following more validation studies. The acquisition will allow integrated diagnostics to offer its customers new and improved blood tests that can be used for detecting lung cancer at an early stage.",

      "premise": "The Swiss Taxi Association plans to launch an app across the country involving some 60 taxi companies to counter online ride-sharing service Uber. This follows a government announcement in favour of deregulation in the digital and sharing economies. “We’re proposing a global solution which benefits taxi drivers as much as it does passengers and businesses,” Michael Sommer, director of SweeTaxi, told Swiss public radio RTS, on Friday. SweeTaxi is implementing the app. The Swiss Taxi Association, which will be officially launched on January 25, wants to improve the profitability of taxis, in particular by competing with Uber. Need a ride or a bed? A smartphone in every hand has made it easier to find others offering them affordably, launching the so-called “sharing ... The Swiss Taxis app aims to optimise vehicle use and reduce operating costs thanks to national agreements on fuel, insurance, and spare parts. Swiss taxi drivers have repeatedly complained about and protested against what they consider to be unfair competition from Uber. Unions have accused the San Francisco-based firm of undercutting fare prices, lacking adequate insurance cover, and failing to enforce the type of quality controls that standard taxi firms are subjected to. On Wednesday, the Swiss cabinet announced that instead of protecting traditional business models, it supported deregulation, which it said would maximise the potential of the digital economy. Economics Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann pointed out that a third of economic growth in Europe today is digitally based. “Digitalisation is a huge opportunity,” he said. He acknowledged, however, that risks exist with digitalisation and sharing platforms such as Uber and Airbnb, which have disrupted traditional business models and threatened jobs. For that reason, the cabinet commissioned a report into developments. This report focused more on approaches than answers, and specifically on the so-called sharing economy for problems facing the hotel industry and taxi firms. Schneider-Ammann said the cabinet saw opportunities in the sharing economy, since resources would be used more efficiently and competition would be boosted. Regarding transport services such as Uber, the report pointed to a parliamentary review that called for taxis and firms like Uber to operate on a level playing field, for example by loosening labour or transport regulations. swissinfo.ch and agencies/ts Horizontal Line Subscribe to the Swiss Connection on iTunes Form for signing up for free newsletter.",

However, the scale of the problem may be even worse as it is thought many attacks go unreported. The data was drawn from a survey of 107 practices in September and October, conducted by Amárach Research for an annual survey of law firms published by accountancy and consulting firm Smith & Williamson. The names of the firms who took part in the research have not been disclosed, but researches said they included 13 of the top 20 firms in the country, 17 mid-tier firms and 77 small firms. Over half of the security breaches reported were caused by malware, while 35pc involved ransomware, where hackers block access to computer systems until a sum of money is paid. The report said cybercrime was on the rise and one of the biggest emerging threats facing the legal profession. It described cybercrime as “a clear and present threat to legal practices in Ireland”, warning attacks will occur more frequently. While data on losses by Irish firms has not been disclosed, the report said British professional indemnity insurer QBE had reported around Stg£85m (€99m) was stolen from client accounts in the previous 18 months in the UK. Four out of ten Irish firms who were subjected to a cyber attack suffered “down time” as a result. Smaller firms appeared to be more vulnerable to a attacks than larger ones. Among the top 20 firms, they reported that despite being more likely to be attacked, they had invested in cyber security to the extent where to date such attacks were having little or no impact on their operations. The Smith & Williamson report said firms needed to be cognisant of the risks of having lax security controls or untrained staff. It said analysing risks requires a review of outsourcings and contractors as well as evaluating the benefits of a cyber insurance policy. “Law firms present a particularly attractive target for cyber criminals. Firms hold sensitive and potentially valuable data about individuals and corporates and may have significant client account balances on hand,” the report said. “Losing client data or funds or having sensitive and confidential information exposed may be the most frightening outcome for a law firm resulting from a cyber attack. “Earlier this year it was reported that law firms were the targets of espionage by hackers who tried to obtain merger and acquisition details in order to facilitate insider trading. “Firms acting in this area are likely to remain at risk from both cybercriminals and nation state attacks.” Online Editors",

      "premise": "NEW YORK, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Barclays Plc won the dismissal on Monday of a Saudi real estate company's $10 billion lawsuit alleging the bank ceased pursuing lease payments due from the Saudi government on military complexes in order to obtain a banking license. New York Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos ruled from the bench in dismissing the 2014 lawsuit by the company, Jadawel International, a unit of London-based MBI International Holdings Inc, a Barclays spokesman said. The lawsuit sought $10 billion in damages for what Jadawel claimed was a fraudulent scheme Barclays hatched to secure the rare Saudi banking license, selling out Jadawel in the process. Barclays contended Jadawel's claims were time-barred and that the lawsuit did not establish a fiduciary relationship between Jadawel and the bank. \"We are pleased with the court's ruling,\" Andrew Smith, a Barclays spokesman, said. A lawyer for Jadawel did not respond to requests for comment. MBI, founded by Sheikh Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber, built two compounds and leased them to the Saudi government in 1999 to house U.S. defense contractors, the lawsuit said. The payments should have totaled over $2 billion through 2017, it said. When Jadawel sought to refinance in 2001, Barclays helped assemble a group of lenders, the lawsuit said. In 2002, the government partially defaulted and Barclays assumed responsibility to collect, it said. As a result, Barclays filed a federal lawsuit seeking damages from the Saudi government. Barclays later caused the lawsuit to be withdrawn, Jadawel's lawsuit said, and sought a bank license from the Saudi Capital Markets Authority, which was considering granting one to a Western financial institution for the first time in decades. Jadawel accused the bank of dropping the lawsuit and compromising the claims for its own benefit, causing it to be deprived hundreds of millions of dollars in lease payments and sell the compounds at a \"substantial loss.\" The bank also was reported to have bribed a Saudi prince and government official to help obtain the license, the lawsuit said. In 2012, Reuters reported that the U.S. government was investigating whether Barclays paid bribes to win a banking license in Saudi Arabia. Barclays has denied doing so.

      "premise": "By Frank Tobe | November 20, 2017 Locus Robotics, a Wilmington, MA-based startup, raised $25 million in a Series B funding led by Silicon Valley Scale Venture Partners, with additional participation from existing investors. Locus plans to use the funds to expand into international markets and build up its growing subscription-based robot fleet. Locus business model uses Robots-as-a-Service (RaaS) which allows customers to use Locus’ solutions without a large-scale capital investment. The story of how Locus came to be is almost as interesting as why their mobile robots and RaaS business mode are getting so much attention and acceptance. In March 2012, in an effort to make their distribution centers (DCs) as efficient as possible, Amazon acquired Kiva Systems for $775 million and almost immediately took them in-house. There was a year of confusion after the acquisition whether Kiva would continue providing DCs with Kiva robots. It became clear that Amazon was taking all Kiva’s production and that, at some future date, Kiva would stop supporting their existing client base and focus entirely on Amazon – which happened in April 2015 when Amazon renamed Kiva to Amazon Robotics and encouraged prospective users of Kiva technology to let Amazon Robotics and Amazon Services provide fulfillment within Amazon warehouses using Amazon robots. Locus Robotics came to be because its founders were early adopters of Kiva Systems robotics technology. When they couldn’t expand with Kiva because Kiva had been taken off the market by Amazon, they were inspired to engineer a system they thought better and which empowered human pickers with mobile robots. The Locus mobile robot and related software are their solution.",

The company was created to provide an alternative service for former customers of robotics company Kiva Systems, which stopped servicing its existing user base in 2015 after being acquired and renamed by Locus'.",

      "premise": "The Series C round takes Reonomy’s total funding raised to date to $68.4 million and comes four months after the proptech firm announced that it had sealed a separate $16 million funding round led by Bain Capital Ventures. The five-year-old Flatiron District-based company said the new capital will be used to further grow and invest in Reonomy’s property data and analytics platform, which its real estate industry clients use to access information on nearly 50 million properties across the U.S.—as well as 150 million unique ownership contacts, roughly 80 million companies, 20 million property sales and 8 million mortgages. “2018 is a tipping point for data in the [commercial real estate] industry,” Reonomy co-Founder and CEO Richard Sarkis said in a statement announcing the funding round. “We’re blown away with how quickly firms are embracing data—and how they’re using Reonomy to fuel greater intelligence, streamline workflows and create new business opportunities.” Last month, the company announced new partnerships with industry giants WeWork, Cushman & Wakefield and Avison Young, who joined nearly two dozen commercial real estate firms and financial institutions that now utilize Reonomy’s data. While those companies make up Reonomy’s “enterprise” customers—most of whom access its database via API feeds in a manner that Sarkis has compared to financial data giant Bloomberg LP’s Bloomberg Terminal—the proptech firm’s platform is also accessible via a web application allowing users to search through commercial real estate assets using more than 300 filters, including property type, size, sale amount, mortgage maturity date and ownership information. “The revolution of data-driven decision-making is hitting commercial real estate just as it has other industries, and we believe Reonomy is leading the way,” David Hartwig, a managing director at Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sapphire Ventures, said in a statement. Hartwig added that in the commercial real estate industry, “the data problem can be particularly tricky” given the “layers of messy data” that firms have to comb through, and said that Sapphire’s “diligence [on Reonomy] uncovered strong customer demand for more and better data delivered through clean APIs and applications.”",

      "premise": "Norwich have capped ticket prices at £30 on their return to the top flight, reviving the issue of accessible pricing for fans in the Premier League. Norwich have announced that every home game will see 1,500 tickets available for sale at £30 to casual home fans which, alongside 22,000 season tickets, will make up the home allocation at the 27,000-capacity Carrow Road. The £30 figure matches the cap levied by the Premier League on away tickets since 2016. “We believe as a football club that we have phenomenal support and we shouldn’t price people out of football”, said the chief operating officer, Ben Kensell. “So we decided that if £30 is fair for away supporters, then £30 is also fair for home supporters considering the price of a home ticket the last time we were in the Premier League. “No one in the ground from a general admission perspective next season will pay more than £30. That, as a club, sets us apart and we’re really proud of that. We think it’s the right thing to do.” The most recent research from the Premier League found the average price of a home match ticket in the division was £31 but this included the costs of season tickets which are often available at a discounted per-match rate. In 2018 just over half the 20 Premier League sides priced their most expensive tickets at around £40 but non-season ticket seats at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium can cost up to £97. Norwich’s new scheme has been hailed by some supporters but the club also came under fire for tying the reduced price to a new membership scheme. Fans must pay £50 to qualify for the general admission tickets and a similar system is being put into place for away tickets, with some supporters claiming the ability to pay is being valued more highly than loyalty. “We’ve never had an away membership before,” Kensell said. “We’ve had a points system instead and, whilst it has been effective over the years, it’s quite antiquated now. We’ve looked at what other Premier League clubs do and looked at what we need to do, spoken with fans and therefore we’ve brought in a two-tier away membership. “I appreciate this level of change will be unsettling to begin with and there will be many different opinions on whether this is a positive or negative step forward but ultimately, as a club, we believe it’s the right thing to tackle the supply and demand issue and ensure that its fair for all supporters.”",
      "hypothesis": "Norwich City has capped the price of 1,500 2018 tickets at £30 ($37.86) for home games. The average cost of home tickets in the division is £31, according to research by the Premier League. However, this includes the cost of season tickets, which are usually discounted on a per-match basis. Norwich's stance has been welcomed by some fans, but others have criticised the club for linking the reduced price to a membership scheme where supporters pay £50 to qualify for general admission tickets.",

Bringing together the company’s recent acquisitions of Good Technology, WatchDox, AtHoc and Encription, the platform provides cloud-enabled enterprise endpoint security. “Businesses must be able to confidentially and reliably transmit sensitive data between endpoints to keep people, information and goods safe,” said John Chen, executive chairman and CEO of BlackBerry. “BlackBerry is uniquely qualified to address this emerging market now because of our deep experience, industry leadership and ongoing product innovation that addresses future business needs.” The company hopes to cater for the collection of devices, computers, sensors, trackers, equipment and other “things” that communicate with each other to enable smart product development, distribution, marketing and sales. Blackberry also said its platform can help to prevent hackers from penetrating devices and computers. It hopes to address the security requirements needed to connect sensors to computers and networks to support secure supply chain communications, ensure patient confidentiality in healthcare and safeguard assets in the financial industry. “Our customers’ investments are protected because this foundational platform is not only compatible with our current products and third-party software, such as Microsoft Office 365, but is also ‘future-proofed’ to address upcoming capabilities such as messaging and analytics,” said Chen. “It allows customers to build their own apps, workflows and business processes, and will be compatible with future applications and cloud-based systems because we have plans to expand the platform’s features, market segments it supports and our entire partner ecosystem,” he added. BlackBerry said it has become the first major mobile software provider to receive the new Cyber Essentials Plus (CE+) certification from the UK government. In the Blackberry blog, senior vice-president of security technology for BlackBerry, Adam Boulton, said the certification covers account management, firewall configuration, device configuration, backup processes and other security-related configurations. Boulton said the Ministry of Defence now mandates CE+ certification across its supply chain. To obtain Cyber Essentials Plus, a qualified and authorised external tester needs to perform additional tests and checks in the organisation. This includes an internal scan of the network, verification of account security for both standard users and administrative accounts, and testing for defences against malicious software installation via email and web browsing. Blackberry is now also an accredited Cyber Essentials Plus certifying body.",

      "premise": "Oct 18 2018 Since 2017, Olympus Corporation has participated in a joint research program that has the potential to help streamline the workload of clinical pathologists, called “A New Approach to Develop Computer-Aided Diagnosis Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Gastric Biopsy Specimens” with Dr. Kiyomi Taniyama, President of the Kure Medical Center and Chugoku Cancer Center. This research paired Dr. Taniyama’s knowledge and experience of pathology diagnosis of the gastric system and digital pathology, with Olympus’ imaging system technology and proficiency in AI development. Olympus, with its leading market share1 in microscopes, has continued to develop a CAD solution using AI for pathology diagnosis based on its proprietary deep learning technology. Olympus used gastric biopsy specimens collected for diagnosis at the Kure Medical Center and Chugoku Cancer Center between 2015 and 2018 to develop deep learning technology, which consisted of a multi-resolutional convolutional neural network2 (CNN). The deep learning technology’s unique CNN was developed by Olympus and is designed to analyze the features of pathology sample images. Using the CNN, the deep learning technology was used to identify the area of ADC tissues on images. Based on the result, images were classified into adenocarcinoma (ADC) and non-adenocarcinoma (NADC). The research involved two stages: the learning stage where the AI learns the CNN model using digital pathology images and associated information, and the prediction stage where the AI classifies ADC images and NADC images using the model that it learned. The AI algorithm was developed using 368 whole slide pathology images for learning, and 786 sample images (297 of ADC and 489 of NADC) for the classification threshold tuning (Table 1). Table 1: When the threshold was set to assess all 297 ADC samples as positive (100% sensitivity), 225 out of the 489 NADC samples were assessed as negative. This represents 100% sensitivity (297 out of 297) and 46% specificity (225 out of 489). The classification threshold determined to detect all ADC achieved 46% specificity with NADCs. With 140 new cases (67 of ADC and 73 of NADC), this algorithm and the threshold achieved 100% sensitivity and 50.7% specificity as a final evaluation (Table 2). Table 2: A final evaluation was made on 140 new sample images (67 samples of ADC and 73 samples of NADC). As a result, all 67 ADC samples were assessed as positive and 37 out of the 73 NADC samples were assessed as negative. This represents 100% sensitivity (67 out of 67) and 50.7% specificity (37 out of 73). CAD software using AI with a low false negative rate6 can help pathologists detect positive samples. This software has the potential to eliminate the duplication of efforts in the workload of pathologists and further improve the accuracy of pathology diagnosis of gastric biopsies (of which, over four million tests are performed annually in Japan) by screening negative samples and helping prevent positive samples from being overlooked.

He has been told that any further property taxes could harm the Government’s already dwindling Stamp Duty takings. The plea comes as the Government plans to introduce an additional Stamp Duty levy of 1% on non-resident purchases, with a consultation due in the New Year. But property investment firm London Central Portfolio (LCP) has warned that analysis of HMRC’s third quarter Stamp Duty receipts shows liable transactions fell 4% annually to 290,740, down 8.7% on three years ago. Tax receipts were also down 8.2% annually, to £2.39bn. Naomi Heaton, chief executive of LCP, said: “The fall is undoubtedly due to investors withdrawing from the market until they can see some light at the end of the Brexit tunnel. “The toxic political climate and stagnating prices have brought ever-growing uncertainty to the residential market following several years of increased taxation. “With the housing market in such a parlous state, it would seem somewhat imprudent for a sitting Chancellor to raise further taxes on the residential sector. “However, this is exactly what Hammond has done, proposing an additional levy of 1% on non-resident purchases in the most recent Budget. “The international buyer, of course, is politically a very easy whipping boy. The reality, however, is that for many new-build developments in the UK’s most prominent cities, where price points are unaffordable for the domestic market, these investors represent a significant proportion of buyers. “HMRC Stamp Duty statistics do not paint a rosy picture of the UK housing market, with neither the buyer nor the Exchequer winning out. “Until the Government has a clear road map for Brexit we are unlikely to see increasing transactions and therefore increased revenues. “While it is highly unlikely that the Government will repeal any of their recent tax increases, it certainly does not seem to be the time to implement more.”",

      "premise": "The Obama administration has made a first installment on its $3bn pledge to help poor countries fight climate change – defying Republican opposition to the president’s environmental plan. The $500m payment to the Green Climate Fund was seen as critical to shoring up international confidence in Barack Obama’s ability to deliver on the pledges made at the United Nations’ climate change conference in Paris in late 2015. Obama is expected to announce a number of joint climate initiatives when the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, visits Washington this week, sources familiar with the plans said. The White House is also working with United Nations officials to encourage countries to formally approve the Paris climate agreement ahead of a signing ceremony on 22 April. At least 55 countries, representing at least 55% of global climate emissions, must ratify the agreement before it takes effect. Administration officials said the initial $500m payment to the Green Climate Fund demonstrated that Obama would follow through on the promises of last December’s Paris climate agreement – despite February’s setback at the supreme court and threats by Republican presidential candidates to dismantle Obama’s agenda. “Today, the United States provided a $500m grant to the Green Climate Fund,” a State Department official said. “This grant is the first step toward meeting the president’s commitment of $3bn to the GCF, and shows that the United States stands squarely behind our international climate commitments.” Administration officials described the payment as an important signal to the international community that Obama was pressing ahead on his climate agenda in his remaining months in the White House. Obama has faced a number of recent setbacks to his climate agenda. The supreme court last month agreed to block the centerpiece of Obama’s climate plan – new rules cutting emissions from power plants – until lower courts rule on legal challenges from 29 states and dozens of industry groups. The ruling created immediate uncertainty about the fate of the power plant rules and the Paris agreement. Obama’s climate plan is also under political attack from Republican presidential contenders who say they will scrap the rules and dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency if they take the White House next November. Republicans in Congress have also threatened to scrap the power plant rules and block any US contributions to the Green Climate Fund, which was set up in 2009 to help poor and vulnerable countries adopt cleaner energy technologies and protect their peoples from rising seas, droughts and other impacts of climate change. At one point Republicans insisted that the Paris agreement be submitted to the Senate for approval before any funds were released – before quietly relenting during budget negotiations last December.",

      "premise": "DETROIT -- General Motors is making a big investment in wind power. The automaker has announced that it is purchasing 200 megawatts of wind energy from wind farms in Ohio and Illinois, and that once the turbines are online next year, 20% of the company's global electricity usage will be powered by renewables. The electricity generated will supply seven plants, including those that make the Chevrolet Cruze and Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty pickups. GM announced last year that it intends to source all electricity needs at its facilities worldwide with renewable energy by 2050. Details about the cost for the wind power purchase were not released, but the company noted a connection to the push for zero-emission vehicles. Those include electric vehicles, such as the Chevrolet Bolt. One of the criticisms of zero-emission vehicles as a cleaner transportation mode is that making the energy to power them still causes pollution, if not as much, just not through the tailpipe.

The company uses (electric vehicle) batteries in tandem with a solar array to power an office building at its Milford Proving Ground in Michigan and is researching the use of fuel cells as energy storage in the future,\" it said. Rob Threlkeld, GM global manager of renewable energy, said that through a \"pragmatic strategy, companies can turn ambitious renewable energy goals into action and scale quickly.” Threlkeld said that the cost to produce wind power continues to drop, making it more feasible to use as a power source in areas closer to most of GM's manufacturing plants. The company said its wind power purchases will be \"enough to meet the electricity needs of Ft. Wayne Assembly, Marion Metal Center and Bedford Casting plants in Indiana and Lordstown Assembly, Defiance Casting Operations, Parma Metal Center and Toledo Transmission plants in Ohio.\" Starwood Energy Group will provide half of the energy through its Northwest Ohio Wind farm in Van Wert and Paulding counties, and Swift Current Energy will provide the rest through its HillTopper Wind Project in Logan County, Ill., the release said. GM says it made its first wind power purchase in 2014 for several Mexican facilities; uses solar power at 26 locations; and gets electricity from landfill gas at two assembly plants. The company says it saves about $5 million each year using renewable energy.",

The Tunisian plant will be built at the ADAM oil concession, while the plant in Pakistan will be situated in close proximity to the Bhit gas field. A company statement highlighted that the projects will support upstream operations by providing green energy with an off-grid set up. The ADAM PV project is situated in the Tataouine governorate, and has a peak capacity of 5MW. The energy produced will be used on-site, reducing gas consumption and avoiding around 6,500 tonnes/year of CO2 equivalent emissions.

The project aims to establish a cutting edge hybrid electricity production system with battery storage devices, in order to enable efficient integration with the existing turbines. The solar PV project for Bhit gas field, with a 10MW peak capacity, is expected to produce approximately 20GWh annually. The output energy will be used on site, reducing gas consumption and avoiding around 140,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions in the next 10 years. The project, expected to be completed by October 2019, aims to integrate the new photovoltaic project with the existing power generating facility. Once operational, it will allow the shutdown of one of the existing gas turbines and consequently to cut down on operational costs. The projects are among the first and most relevant of their kind globally, and in both cases aim to create value with the gas saved in the process.

      "premise": "Written by Dana Sanchez Sep 20, 2019 Harvard University’s admissions policies are increasingly under scrutiny, and the Ivy League school is not alone. “Higher education is now in a litigation frenzy,” said Peter Lake, a law professor at Stetson University, in an EducationDive article. “We’re facing legal accountability that’s almost unprecedented.” Less than 16 percent of African American Harvard admissions are recruited athletes, legacies, dean’s list, and children of faculty and staff compared to 43 percent of white admissions, according to a new paper by three economics professors. The same is true for Asian American and Hispanic admits to Harvard — less than 16 percent each. Three economics professors used publicly released reports to examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s list, and children of faculty and staff. They published their findings in a report dated Sept. 11, 2019, entitled “Legacy and Athlete Preferences at Harvard.” In their abstract, the authors credited the lawsuit, Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University, with providing an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Listen to GHOGH with Jamarlin Martin | Episode 67: Jamarlin Martin Jamarlin goes solo to discuss the NFL’s entertainment and “social justice” deal with Jay-Z. We look back at the Barclays gentrification issue in the documentary “A Genius Leaves The Hood: The Unauthorized Story of Jay-Z.” The authors are Peter Arcidiacono, professor of Economics at Duke University; Josh Kinsler, associate economics professor at University of Georgia; and Tyler Ransom, assistant professor of economics at University of Oklahoma. Arcidiacono was the expert witness in a lawsuit, Students for Fair Admissions vs. Harvard University, according to College Confidential. “Our model of admissions shows that roughly three-quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs,” the authors wrote in their abstract. “Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.” Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) is an anti-affirmative action group that sued Harvard University for race-conscious admissions policies in 2014, EducationDive reported. SFFA alleges that Harvard’s admissions officers hold Asian American applicants to a higher standard than other students. The case is awaiting a federal judge’s decision and could go to the Supreme Court. There are growing calls to end university legacy admissions, which have been called “affirmative action for the rich” and “affirmative action for whites.” In the comments section at Marginal Revolution University, Bill wrote, “As a lawyer, I would advise that in order to get your kid into Harvard, you should publicly disavow, disclaim and disinherit your child. And, have that child then be adopted by a Harvard alum who is also on the faculty.” “Sounds like affirmative action for privileged white kids,”@BarbBanfieldRN tweeted. “The other students should all be giving THEM the side eye, like they didn’t really earn their spot and don’t really belong because they got preferential treatment.”",
      "hypothesis": "Fewer than 16% of black, Asian and Hispanic admissions to Harvard University were the result of being offered places through a preference policy. The percentage of black students admitted in 2015 was lower than it had been for several years, but still higher than at any time since the early 1970s. Of those, the study also showed almost 75% would have been denied entry had they been treated the same as non-white ALDCs. The study was inspired by a lawsuit brought against Harvard by Students for Fair Admissions, alleging race-conscious admissions.",

Although small-scale, the move by the “diagou” seller, via a partnership with a Chinese-backed New Zealand dairy supplier, will give it exposure to soaring Chinese demand for Australasian dairy products, pushing its shares to a five-month high. It also underscores increased competition for a2 Milk itself in a market that has delivered it fat margins and big profits. “We believe there’s room in the market for more brands,” AuMake Executive Chairman Keong Chan told Reuters by phone. “The market’s so large - looking from China, a2 is not particularly well known ... we think there is still a lot of the market that’s being unmet.” Regular milk contains both A1 and A2 proteins but some cows naturally produce milk without the A1 protein. Proponents of A2-only milk say the A1 protein causes indigestion for many people, while critics say more research is needed. AuMake’s supply deal with New Zealand’s Pure Nutrition Ltd, majority owned by Ausnutria Dairy Corp Ltd, is part of a broader trend. Nestle SA, the world’s biggest infant formula maker launched an A2 product in March. “There are more newbies ... but there is no evidence that any of them are taking market share from a2,” said Oyvinn Rimer, director at major a2 Milk shareholder Harbour Asset Management. “In fact it’s been the other way around - the total market will grow when more people talk about it and a2 milk is the logical beneficiary of more consumer awareness.” a2 Milk Company told Reuters in an emailed statement that “there is a high degree of difficulty” in successfully launching a new brand. AuMake, which listed last October, operates a retail network aimed at “daigou” or shoppers who purchase products for customers in mainland China, in a bid to avoid high import duties. Financial terms of the AuMake deal were not disclosed. Pure Nutrition is contracted to deliver a million tins of A1 milk powder and 600,000 tins of A2 powder by April or May next year. AuMake shares jumped 14 percent to A$0.30, their highest since March, while the broader market fell slightly. A2 Milk shares edged lower in New Zealand.

Investors dumped equities around the globe amid concerns about rapidly rising interest rates, a possible global economic slowdown and overly ambitious tech valuations. The Nasdaq on Thursday became the first major benchmark to fall into correction territory. Sources told the Journal that Tencent Music was originally set to kick off its roadshow next week and begin trading the following week.

      "premise": "The broadcaster, for instance, wants to use data to \"better understand what audiences want from the BBC.\" The organisation could, of course, simply poll licence fee payers, but the idea presumably is to burrow down into TV and iPlayer viewing habits. With a wealth of hard data, it's possible that an algorithm could pick out larger trends and deduce whether the BBC is using its resources most effectively. To that end, the BBC hopes machine learning can help it build \"a more personal BBC\" with tools that could allow employees to make informed editorial and commissioning decisions. The broadcaster is also interested in a concept called object-based broadcasting. At the moment, TV shows and news bulletins are broadcast as single pieces of linear media. But for years now, the BBC has envisioned media \"objects,\" or blocks, that could be assembled in different ways depending on the user or end-hardware. Take the news, for instance: If every story or segment was cut-up, it could be personalised based on your tastes. Maybe you want the sport first, with more time dedicated to women's football. Or a shorter, snappier version of the local news. Machine learning could, in theory, help the BBC realise this abstract dream. Machine learning is a buzzword at the moment, but with good reason. Engineers are teaching computers to learn, adapt and analyse based on relevant examples. It's led to improvements in voice recognition, translation, and if you're Google's DeepMind division, world champion 'Go' players. It's no surprise that the BBC wants to leverage this new area of AI development in its own business. Media companies like Netflix have embraced user data to shape every part of its services, from commissioning to thumbnail designs. The BBC needs to do the same, especially as it pivots to a model increasingly dependent on original, British programming.",
      "hypothesis": "The BBC plans to use machine learning to optimise its online services and its commissioned programme selection through a five-year research partnership with eight UK universities. The Data Science Research Partnership will develop projects across Europe for media and technology companies, applying its discoveries to BBC products. The broadcaster hopes that machine learning can help it personalise its service through data analysis so it can make better commissioning and editorial choices. The company is also exploring “object-based broadcasting”, or breaking programmes into shorter segments that can be assembled into tailored broadcasting for viewers.",

Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid, deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon.",

WeWork taking over large LinkedIn lease in Mountain View WeWork, a shared-office space startup, has obtained more than 450,000 square feet in a Mountain View shopping center that is currently under construction. The New York company will take over a lease from LinkedIn at The Village at San Antonio Center, according to May Chow, a LinkedIn spokeswoman. The center — which is set to be completed in late 2017 — will also feature cafes, restaurants, a boutique hotel and a movie theater, according to its website. “LinkedIn has reassigned its lease at The Village at San Antonio Center, and will not be setting up offices there,” Chow said in an email. WeWork could not be reached for comment. WeWork, founded in 2010, offers flexibility to companies that are too small, or have too many remote employees, to justify leasing an entire office. Its business model involves renting out large office spaces and then leasing out smaller spaces to other companies. Lenny Siegel, the vice mayor of Mountain View, applauded this move. He said it will open up more space for startups to grow in the city, which is dominated by tech giants such as Google, LinkedIn and Symantec. “This is still the best place in the world for start a company, but the squeeze in real estate created by growth of our largest companies has made it difficult for companies to find space here,” he said. “We’re looking for a diverse commercial ecosystem here,” Siegel added. WeWork currently has more than 160 locations worldwide, 14 of them in the Bay Area. On Tuesday, Hudson’s Bay, the company that owns retail giant Lord & Taylor, said it is selling its flagship store in New York City to WeWork, which will use the space for its headquarters.

Most of Egypt’s PV capacity is expected to be installed in the Aswan region. Image:Flickr/Francisco Abadal The Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) will review six bids for the 200 MW Kom Ombo solar PV project in Egypt, according to a press release issued by Spanish solar developer, Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV), which is part of UAE-based Abdul Latif Jameel Energy. It has reportedly submitted the lowest offer, at $0.02791 per kWh. The second lowest bidder, according to FRV, was Saudi energy giant, ACWA Power, which bid $0.02799 per kWh, while the third lowest offer was proposed by Norway’s Scatec Solar at $0.03045 per kWh. The remaining three bidders are the consortia EDF-Marubeni-El Sewedy, Engie-Orascom, and Actis-Enerpal. According to Daily News Egypt, the first offered $0.0315 per kWh, while the other two entities offered $0.034 and $0.035 per kWh, respectively. The selected developer will be granted a 25-year PPA with EETC, and the plant will be installed in the Aswan region, where most of the country’s PV capacity is expected to be located. The transmission company began receiving bids for the 200 MW project in March. The Kom Ombo plant is being procured and developed with the support of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which has so far invested in several large-scale projects in Egypt. In October, the bank identified 16 new solar projects in the country, with a cumulative capacity of 750 MW, which will receive financing. Emiliano joined pv magazine in March 2017.

      "premise": "A week after spinning out its driver services business and giving it $1 billion in investment capital, Didi Chuxing has added to it through an acquisition. Xiaoju Automobile Solutions (XAS), which the Didi spinout is called, announced today it has bought Hiservice, a three-year-old company that provides after-service care for car owners using a digital platform. The deal was undisclosed, but XAS said that Hiservice will be combined with its maintenance and repair division to form a new unit that’s focused on car-owner services such as maintenance, parts and components. That’ll be called Xiaoju Auto Care (小桔养车) for those of you who are keeping up with the names of these Didi subsidiaries. That auto care business will be jointly run by Yinbo Yi, who had run Didi’s auto care business, and Hiservice founder Cheng Qian, Didi confirmed. The new business claims 28 physical maintenance centers across seven cities in Asia. Didi’s move to create XAS, which removes an asset-heavy business from the core Didi books, is seen by many as a sign that the company plans to go public soon. Unsurprisingly, Didi isn’t commenting on that at this point. The company was last valued at $56 billion when it raised a $4 billion round late last year — it has since added a $500 million strategic investment from travel company Booking Holdings. While it is organizing its China-based business, Didi has also spent this year expanding into new markets. It has launched in Mexico, Australia and Taiwan while it acquired Uber rival 99 in Brazil. It is also edging close to launching a taxi-booking service in Japan via a joint venture with SoftBank.",

Not only that, they want to move in quickly and have all facilities automatically provided for them on arrival. That’s why we’re now seeing large multinationals such as Facebook and Microsoft opting for flexible workspace in the city. It’s no longer just start-ups or SMEs that are looking for this option.” Click puts the size of Dublin’s serviced office market at 23,000 desks which will rise to almost 30,000 by the end of 2019. It says there is 106,838sq m (1.15 million sq ft) of serviced office space in the capital, up from 69,677sq m (750,000sq ft) last year. The serviced office market includes Irish providers Iconic Offices, Pembroke Hall and Glandore as well as international companies WeWork and Regus. Click finds that there are 55 serviced office providers in Dublin, with five (WeWork, Regus, Iconic, Glandore and Pembroke Hall) controlling about 55 per cent of the market. The average monthly price of a desk in Dublin, according to Click, has remained steady at €500 per desk while desks at the lower end start at €300. Desks in many of the larger, more modern spaces start from €650 per month. A global shift towards serviced offices, co-working and hot desking started in the US more than a decade ago but has only recently gone mainstream in the Irish market. WeWork, for example, opened four serviced office centres in Dublin last year at North Wall Quay, George’s Quay and Harcourt Road. It looks set to expand its presence in Dublin this year by opening two new office spaces in the city centre, bringing its capacity to more than 8,000 desks. Kenneth Dwyer, sales manager with Regus, says people and businesses of all sizes are “waking up to the financial and strategic benefits of serviced offices”.",

      "premise": "China could waste as much as half a trillion dollars on unnecessary new coal-fired power stations, a climate campaign group has said, arguing that the world’s top carbon polluter already has more than enough such facilities. China’s rise to become the world’s second largest economy was largely powered by cheap, dirty coal. But as growth slows, the country has had a difficult time weaning itself off the fuel, even as the pollution it causes wreaks havoc on the environment and public health. Many of China’s giant state-owned coal mining firms are unviable and plagued by overcapacity, but the ruling Communist party is reluctant to turn off the financial taps and risk widespread unemployment, with its potential for anger and unrest. As of July, China already had 895 gigawatt in coal-fired power stations – representing more than half its electricity generation – said the London-based Carbon Tracker Initiative, which argues for limiting carbon emissions using financial data. The country was operating the coal units at less than half their capacity, the campaign group said on Monday, but “perversely” had another 205GW already under construction and plans for an additional 405GW. At an estimated $800m per kW, that could cost $490bn in total, CTI said. “This misallocation of capital is a microcosm of wider structural woes within the Chinese economy,” it said in a report. Power demand growth had slowed from 10% to 3% or less per year, it added. Even if power consumption grew at 5% a year until 2020 and coal-fired stations were run at 45% capacity, it said, existing plants and those currently under construction would be more than enough. “China no longer needs to build any additional coal plants and therefore should act with conviction to contain its coal overcapacity crisis,” the report said. Beijing has repeatedly pledged to cut overcapacity in several sectors as it seeks to reform the economy to make it more efficient. It set a target of reducing coal production capacity by 250m tonnes this year, which premier Li Keqiang announced last week had been met by the end of October. But even though capacity cuts do not necessarily lead to reductions in production, they have been blamed for rising coal prices, giving stricken producers a new lease of financial life. CTI’s comments echo statements by the environmental campaign group Greenpeace, which estimated in July that China has up to 300GW of excess coal-fired capacity. Two new coal power plant projects were being begun each week across 10 different provinces, Greenpeace said. China’s current five-year plan – a blueprint for economic and social development in 2016 to 2020 – was “disappointing” and “far from ambitious enough” in tackling coal power overcapacity, Greenpeace has said. Public discontent about the environment has grown in China, leading the government to declare a “war on pollution” and vow to reduce the proportion of energy derived from fossil fuels, but critics say efforts have fallen short of expectations.",
      "hypothesis": "China could waste up to $490bn building unnecessary new coal-fired power stations because it already has enough facilities and an overcapacity crisis, says the Carbon Tracker Initiative. However, the Beijing government is reluctant to stop financing unviable state-owned plants due to the risk of widespread unemployment and the potential for increasing levels of civil unrest, leading the CTI to state; “This misallocation of capital is a microcosm of wider structural woes within the Chinese economy.” In a week, Greenpeace estimated China had \"up to 300GW of excess coal-fired capacity\" yet 10 provinces continued to add two coal power plant projects July.",

      "premise": "Scrapping EU tariffs on foreign imports after Brexit would do little to cut the cost of a weekly shop in the UK, according to a report. In new research contradicting Brexiters’ claims that leaving the EU could lower the price of food on the shelves, the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank said consumers would see little benefit from the removal of trade tariffs, which are a form of tax applied on imported goods. Designed to protect domestic industry and agriculture – although sometimes criticised for driving up the cost of consumer goods – import tariffs on goods arriving in Britain are currently dictated by Brussels as part of the UK’s membership of the EU customs union. Leaving the EU gives the government an opportunity to set an independent trade policy and to cut the tariffs charged on imports, which Brexit backers have said would make the UK more competitive and benefit consumers. However, the IFS said the removal of these tariffs would reduce prices by as much as 1.2% overall. That would fail to offset the 2% increase in consumer prices caused by the sudden drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote, which has put pressure on household budgets and led to a slowdown in spending on the high street. The report is likely to reignite debate over the shape of Britain’s post-Brexit trade policy. Labour has called on the government to stay in a customs union with the EU, while the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, and other Brexit supporters want to strike new deals with the rest of the world. However, the prospect of a global trade war instigated by Donald Trump could undermine Britain’s chances of striking new deals, while campaigners have also warned the government against lowering its health and safety standards to boost trade volumes. Prof Patrick Minford, who leads the pro-Brexit Economists for Free Trade group of academics, criticised the findings of the IFS report, which was funded by the group UK in a Changing Europe. He said abolishing import tariffs could lower consumer prices by 8% and boost economic output.",
      "hypothesis": "UK shoppers would see only a very modest fall in prices after EU tariffs are removed following Brexit, according to a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The report found scrapping EU tariffs would reduce prices by about 1.2% overall but this would not offset the 2% increase in prices caused by the devalued pound following the referendum on EU membership. The report contradicted claims by Brexit supporters that the removal of EU tariffs would lead to lower prices.",

      "premise": "ABB’s solar inverter business has approximately 800 employees in more than 30 countries, with manufacturing and R&D sites located in Italy, India and Finland. It includes the solar inverter business from Power-One which was acquired by ABB’s Discrete Automation and Motion division in 2013. It is currently within ABB’s Electrification business and achieved revenues of approximately $290 million in 2018, down from a high of $743 million in 2012, according to Reuters. Fimer has stated it will honor all existing warranties and ABB will compensate the company for taking the business and its liabilities over. As a result, ABB expects to take an after-tax non-operational charge of approximately $430 million in the second quarter of 2019 with the half-year results of 2019 being impacted accordingly. Around 75 percent of this charge is represented by cash outflows ABB will pay to Fimer from the deal closing date through 2025. In addition, ABB expects up to $40 million of carve-out related separation costs starting in the second half of 2019. After closing of the transaction, ABB expects the operational EBITA margin for the electrification business to be impacted positively by slightly more than 50 basis points, supporting the business’ progress towards its target margin corridor of 15-19 percent. Completion is expected in the first quarter of 2020 and will be subject to certain conditions, including the completion of the carve-out and prior consultation with employee representative bodies. Filippo Carzaniga, CEO of Fimer, speaking on the acquisition, said, “We are glad to announce this further step in our development as FIMER’s focus on the solar business will be greatly enhanced by this integration. We will continue the excellent job carried out by ABB in recent years, combining precious resources, knowledge and expertise in Italy and worldwide. With a strengthened portfolio, we are better placed to shape the future of this increasingly strategic business.”",
      "hypothesis": "ABB has sold its solar inverter unit to Italian firm Fimer, in order to focus on other markets. Fimer will honour the division's existing warranties, while ABB will reimburse Fimer for taking on its liabilities. The unit, which develops and makes its products in Italy, India and Finland, has around 800 staff in over 30 countries. The deal is expected to complete early next year.",
