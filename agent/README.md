# Agent Workspace

## Purpose
This folder is dedicated to **agent-authored work only**. The agent conducts error analysis of the **Logify neuro-symbolic system** (an ongoing, unpublished research project) and writes a paper for the **AI Agents for Qualitative Research (AI Agents4Qual 2026)** conference.

## Project Context
**Logify** is an ongoing research project developing a neuro-symbolic framework for legal document reasoning. The system is under active development and aims to improve upon RAG baselines by combining neural extraction with symbolic reasoning. This analysis examines error patterns in early experimental results to inform design improvements.

## Conference Details

**Conference:** AI Agents for Qualitative Research 2026
**Website:** https://www.aiagents4qual.org/call-for-papers/
**Date:** March 13, 2026 (virtual)
**Submission Deadline:** January 31, 2026
**Decision Notification:** February 28, 2026
**Cost:** Free

## Paper Requirements

### Format
- **Maximum Length:** 3,500 words (excluding references and author reflection)
- **Template:** Official conference template with mandatory AI Contribution Disclosure checklist
- **Submission:** Anonymous via OpenReview platform

### Content Requirements
Papers must be **predominantly authored by generative AI systems** (Claude, ChatGPT, LLaMA, etc.). Requirements:
- At least half the research process done by AI
- Nearly all writing done by AI
- Minimal human contribution

### Mandatory Components
1. **AI Disclosure:** Name every AI tool/model used
2. **Role Transparency:** Document distribution between AI and human roles
3. **Autoethnographic Reflection:** Critical analysis of AI interaction including:
   - Prompting strategies
   - Moments of control/release
   - Surprising outcomes
   - Failures and contradictions

## Review Process
- Three LLMs independently evaluate submissions
- Human organizers review top-ranked submissions
- Priority given to papers emphasizing failures, contradictions, and reflective analysis over polished results

## Focus Areas
- Experimentation in AI-driven qualitative research methodology
- Creative exploration of authorship and agency in knowledge creation
- Error analysis to inform iterative system development
- Understanding failure modes in neuro-symbolic architectures

## Research Goals
1. Identify systematic error patterns in Logify's underperforming cases
2. Understand why the system shows mixed performance (strong on some documents, weak on others)
3. Provide actionable design insights for:
   - Negation handling in extraction pipeline
   - Query translation semantic grounding
   - Contradiction detection in solver logic
4. Demonstrate AI agent capabilities in diagnostic analysis for ongoing projects

## Working Files
- `agent_text.tex` - Main paper draft in LaTeX format
